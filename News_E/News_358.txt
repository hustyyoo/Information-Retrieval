We condemn in the strongest terms the cowardly terrorist attacks in Afghanistan, Somalia, and Yemen, which have claimed dozens of innocent lives. We extend our deepest sympathies to the families and friends of those killed, and wish a speedy recovery to those who were wounded. These attacks only strengthen the resolve of responsible nations to pursue, destroy, and rid the world of terrorists, and we will never waver.
