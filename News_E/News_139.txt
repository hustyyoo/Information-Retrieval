Today marks the one-year anniversary of the Assad regime’s unconscionable sarin nerve gas attack on the town of Khan Shaykhun, which resulted in hundreds of civilian casualties. The women, children, and men who died at the hands of the Assad regime on April 4, 2017, deserve justice and we will not rest until the regime is held accountable. We expect all parties involved to live up to their promise in 2013 and to ensure that the Assad regime stops its senseless use of chemical weapons against the Syrian people.
