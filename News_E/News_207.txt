And throughout this capital city, from the Supreme Court to the Lincoln Memorial to the beautiful, beautiful White House — you like the White House?  — (applause) — what a house — we see the magnificence of Greek architecture.Finally, we see Greece’s enduring influence through so many Americans of Greek descent who contribute so much to this nation that we love.In celebrating Greek independence, we honor this influence and we remember our common heritage.  We take renewed confidence that whatever challenges we might face anytime in the future, we will face them together — we’ll all be together — as members of a great community of nations.And like our ancestors, we too will draw strength from the bonds of history and culture that unite our countries and shape our destinies.Today, we celebrate Greek independence.  Such an important day, and a day that so many people called; they wanted to be here.  And many of them were not Greek.  So you’ll have to explain that to me.  (Laughter.)  But they wanted to be here.  And we renew our commitment to the values and principles that make us who we are.   We stand together for freedom and justice and democracy today and for all time.Thank you for joining us for this incredible celebration.May God bless you.  May God bless Greece.  (Applause.)  And may God bless the United States of America.  (Applause.)And now, I’d like to introduce His Eminence to say a few words.  Thank you very much.  Thank you all.  (Applause.)END6:03 P.M.
