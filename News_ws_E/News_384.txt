Station 2025 encourages America ’ pioneering space companies private sector increase activity low-Earth orbit government partner customer competitor Applause And last night great privilege announce ’

Applause Thank you.We President Trump says nation pioneers And I assure firmly believes past triumphs draw us onward upward begin new journeys exploration reclaim destiny vanguard humanity ’ great adventure outer reaches space.What choose space like every frontier plays vital role lives people future nation Earth It accelerates scientific discovery spurs groundbreaking innovations fuels businesses serves eyes ears America ’ warfighters quite literally creates jobs future.And ’ America ’ Space Coast see importance nation ’ space enterprise You see Alabama Mississippi California Washington State every one America ’ 50 states hardworking men women get every day help build world ’ advanced rockets satellites spaceships.In fact thousands companies across country today working America ’ deep-space exploration systems alone And continue push solar system new businesses entire enterprises built seize infinite possibilities us And limit jobs prosperity created across country.Over past year I ’ privilege travel across country meet men women forging America ’ future space In Huntsville Alabama I met engineers technicians working Space Launch System send American astronauts back magnificent desolation moon red sands Mars.At California ’ Mojave Space Port I climbed aboard spaceship carry first generation space tourists edge Earth ’ atmosphere peer cosmic expanse heavens And I walked atop massive vessel soon launch satellites soaring skies I saw eyes innovations born America ’ entrepreneurs captains industry turn gaze infinite frontier ’ inspiring.At Schriever Air Force Base I saw strength surveillance navigation communication system support America ’ men women uniform defend families freedom around world.And Redstone Arsenal I saw steps ’ taking strengthen national security capabilities space meet threats posed aggressive pursuit antisatellite capabilities America continue dominant heavens Earth.At Johnson Space Center Houston I met newest class American astronauts inspiring Americans I saw courage pioneering spirit ’ always defined country continues spur people break barriers set new records carry nation even greater heights.And week I returned America ’ Space Coast tour facilities launching pad national heroes permanent symbol nation ’ unquestioned leadership space.President Trump entire administration believe America ’ prosperity security even national character depend American leadership space And past year world seen vital role private enterprise plays advance American leadership outer space.We ’ seen increasing number American businesses sending experiments International Space Station We ’ witnessed power commercial satellites reconnect isolated communities wake natural disasters.And course couple weeks ago world watched wonder Falcon Heavy blasted shoreline moments later sent two boosters sailing back Earth landed side-by-side intact less mile ’ lifted Very impressive indeed Applause The evidence clear While government blaze new trails exploring outer expanse space like frontiers ultimately settled dreams people brilliance innovators energy entrepreneurs daring explorers together.This truth echoes history Kennedy Space Center named President challenged American people marshal best words “ energies skills ” “ become world ’ leading space-faring nation. ” It early summer morning 1961 Alan Shepard crawled Mercury capsule Freedom 7 perched atop 82-foot rocket ventured void It eight years later crew Apollo 11 carried hopes dreams American people moon claimed place undisputed leader exploration space.And ’ today 21st century modern marvels launch grounds prove public private sectors achieving far together ever apart.Since January last year 20 rockets designed built sent space America ’ pioneering space companies launched Space Coast names like Falcon Delta Atlas Minotaur And feats American enterprise ingenuity attest — much bridge space Kennedy Space Center bridge future Applause Today speak American businesses developing new rockets — I saw last night — spaceships satellites taking us space ever renewing confidence achieve impossible again.Not long ago one would dreamt landing vehicle asteroid mine minerals opening private space station tourists scientists entrepreneurs operating satellite refueling station hundreds miles Earth.But today emerging businesses And like railroads opened American West explorers entrepreneurs technologies extend range American action values new worlds usher new era job creation innovation driven space.But American industry technology leapt toward future government agencies often remained stuck past Consider case satellite servicing begin — transformative new technology dramatically extend life nation ’ satellites unlock untold new opportunities space industry In past whenever satellite ran fuel replaced An expensive time-consuming process — like buying new car every time runs gas.We within reach technology get around problem But National Space Council already come understand American businesses want launch satellite-servicing missions often stifled convoluted maze bureaucratic obstacles outdated regulatory processes Today ’ launch-licensing regime plagued burdensome government barriers And make matters worse launch licenses ’ transferred often one site another learned last meeting National Space Council.So company receives licenses launch rocket Kennedy Space Center wants move mission California even miles away Cape Canaveral company must complete entire process start finish.The government figured honor driver ’ licenses across state lines There ’ reason ’ rockets Applause And point ’ reason federal government stand way trailblazing companies forging re-forging American leadership space.Today National Space Council discuss new policy recommendations break bureaucratic hurdles These recommendations I believe transform licensing regimes oversee launch re-entry new commercial space operations And ’ empower American businesses create jobs future attract new investment shores unlock new opportunities new technologies new sources American prosperity.With reforms American private enterprise usher new era space leadership propel economy strengthen national security rekindle belief America continue accomplish anything put minds to.As President Trump said “ It America ’ destiny leader amongst nations adventure great unknown. ” And ’ going write next chapter adventure American industry American ingenuity partner This I know ’ ’ American people always done.If think less 35 years Lewis Clark returned expedition wilderness nearly half new nation ’ population already moved west There pioneers settlers traders entrepreneurs Americans — fellow travelers nation ’ never-ending journey explore undiscovered lands venture far-off places expand horizons influence.No sooner tamed Wild West America ’ destiny beckoned us skies At turn last century two brothers Ohio — one born Indiana — sped sands Kitty Hawk become first flight And 66 years later race Moon.Like many precious memories youth gathered around black-and-white television watching heroes — heroes hurdling heavens making history — like Buzz Aldrin gathers us today second man moon Applause And today rising generation filled wonder pride every time see new triumphs adventures America ’ leadership space.Now every photograph faraway galaxy transmit across solar system classrooms inspires us dream big dreams Every galactic discovery helps us unlock mystery Earth stretches minds beyond limits Earth-bound existence And every rocket launch stars proves America sky limit.Today stand dawn new era American leadership space And would well remember words spoken late Gene Cernan last man walk moon boarded lunar module 45 years ago He said I quote “ America ’ challenge today forged man ’ destiny tomorrow. ” The Apollo astronauts first Americans tell children grandchildren went heavens stood another place It ’ duty ensure work last
