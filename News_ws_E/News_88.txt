going great things But importantly ’ much helping us border North Korea ’ continuing And know view something I think ’ certainly beneficial Getting rid nuclear weapons good Good everybody.But really great help us border North Korea maybe plays ’ I think I think everything But perhaps ’ one reasons helpful They ’ really terrific helping us get kind settlement.Meetings set right Kim Jong-un — I think terrific I think ’ going lot respect ’ see happens So ’ come long way But China really helped us border appreciate Okay Larry Kudlow.KUDLOW Yes sir Thank Let add Trump economic policies designed succeeding promoting economic growth U.S. We ’ already running 3 percent growth last three quarters People said ’ There may sloppy quarter someplace trend unmistakable.I say — know I ’ growth guy — better economic growth helps everyone Everyone I ’ care industry sector state region Growth helps everyone The 155 million Americans benefitting growth New businesses existing businesses new investments existing investments Getting rid tax burdens regulatory burdens help ’ paramount.In connection President ’ trade initiatives designed promote growth If lose sight get various details I urge think worst case every situation I urge We ’ got one greatest negotiators planet He ’ laid menu options Everything table If ’ it.But ’ also positive side As President said ’ good signals China change past days The President signaled back Great discussions going The China initiatives respect technology barriers autos farming designed end process — I call end rainbow — promote growth There ’ pot gold And open pot better growth prosperity every part country every working person country That ’ design punish ’ grow We never talked punishment.And I spoke lot House members Republican inaudible earlier morning I said I hope I ’ violate anything sir Stay us go difficult process Stay us And end worst case come President said helped That ’ promise I echo promise But stay us The next months could important And succeed — I believe ’ going succeed — growth dividend prosperity ’ seen 20 years.So trade initiative part growth policies folds nicely lower tax rates lower regulations And President Trump ended war business ’ part We grow 4 percent — knows This good stuff even though ’ difficult process ’ aimed growth That ’ Kudlow message I ’ saying many decades I ’ still saying And best growth policies I ’ seen since I kid working Reagan.THE PRESIDENT Thank Larry much Beautifully said.Just finish tremendous numbers coming companies We hundreds billions dollars pouring back country tax cut plan money overseas coming Larry often mention talk Apple example investing 350 billion plants — ’ many — campuses everything else.Other companies investing billions dollars back country So ’ bringing billions dollars I would say ahead schedule even far ahead schedule And ’ going create growth jobs everything else.As know 32 solar plants 32 I think 30 closed Larry right There — ’ new industry getting absolutely killed China others And put tariff panels coming nearly good ones make And two open Can imagine 32 two — limping along barely open.These two well ’ looking open seven eight nine plants Same thing washing machines They dumping — believe — washing machines country Just dumping And put 30 percent tariff washing machine plants expanding opening country.So I want use tariffs judiciously certainly help The steel aluminum industry — 10 percent aluminum And probably seen I sort thought might happen aluminum 4 percent since put 10 percent tariff So someday somebody going explain I ’ think would good I thought maybe would go little bit.Steel taken tariff countries ’ able renegotiate deals For instance South Korea heard pay 25 percent tariff steel coming went absolutely crazy made deal The KORUS deal pretty much concluded And really made I would say Bob largely fact like fact pay tariffs steel.So ’ able — even European Union ’ happy steel ’ negotiating I ’ know would negotiating without steel And I say hear I ’ care less They hear it.In cases people paying tariffs ’ taking lot money country Those tariffs tremendous We ’ taking lot money Not bad either But tariffs really helped us When used properly really get people table And ’ want But I want people table also great American farmers ag industry I love people We ’ taking care people And ’ working really well.So thank much And thank much Thank you.Q Mr. President military action Syria inevitable sir Is way avoid THE PRESIDENT We ’ meeting today Syria We ’ number meetings today We
