Director Christopher Wray laid different timeline White House telling us one would seem contradiction timeline White House laid terms knew Rob Porter Can speak Director said He seemed indicate first would known might March June November January case actually closed.MS SANDERS Look explained process extensively last week The White House Personnel Security Office staffed career officials received information last year considered final background investigation report November But made final recommendation adjudication White House process still ongoing Rob Porter resigned.In view Personnel Security Office FBI ’ July report required significant additional investigatory fieldwork Personnel Security Office could begin evaluate information adjudication.As Director Wray said information still coming White House Personnel Security Office February.Q So clear — July report back March information contained reports allegations Rob Porter MS SANDERS I ’ access information I ’ know answer John.Kristen.Q I want drill one important fact Raj said investigation ongoing Christopher Wray said closed January So ’ telling truth MS SANDERS Both As I said FBI portion closed The White House Personnel Security Office one makes recommendation adjudication finished process therefore made recommendation White House.Q And let clarify one point You said yesterday ’ get paperwork FBI Chris Wray said submit paperwork various months inaudible .MS SANDERS Again would come White House Personnel Security Office completed investigation passed information White House.Q But acknowledge receive paperwork.MS SANDERS Again White House — I think need clear — ’ multiple groups here.The White House Personnel Security Office staffed career officials would — may received information completed process made recommendation White House adjudication.Q And Sarah finally allowed John Kelly — Rob Porter rather stay without permanent security clearance MS SANDERS I ’ comment specifics ’ already said matter.Cecilia.Q And Sarah could answer questions —MS SANDERS Sorry Kristen I ’ going keep moving got short time fuse today.Q Is White House still maintaining John Kelly really idea allegations domestic abuse story broke MS SANDERS I give best information I ’ understanding.Q And President believe women MS SANDERS Again President takes accusations seriously He believes due process Above everything else supports victims type violence certainly would condemn violence anyone.Q But still ’ heard say The cameras front today —MS SANDERS Again President dictated specifically comment yesterday I read guys.Zeke.Q Thanks Sarah I ’ got two First speak — anyone White House Personnel Security Office communication anyone West Wing Rob Porter ’ clearance FBI started submitting interim reports —MS SANDERS I ’ aware communication I ’ say definitively I ’ aware communication.Q And secondly — Capitol Hill today interview Associated Press DNI Coates said interim security clearances granted — limited access classified information rather access full gamut full clearance would provide.Can speak whether current practice right large number — significant number officials whether West Wing broader White House complex The President ’ aides ’ permanent security clearances limited access classified information MS SANDERS I ’ speak whether people interim permanent security clearances therefore ’ comment process.We following process used previous administrations would rely law enforcement intelligence communities determine process needed changed.Q But DNI suggested would changed.MS SANDERS And would ones would make determination play role changes would look like.Josh.Q Sarah saying four different occasions FBI obviously said made White House aware allegations White House said — officials said Tuesday night realize extent allegations Should someone FBI Personnel Security Office punished telling White House officials How two things MS SANDERS That ’ something would well beyond scope determine Josh.Q Is President upset though ’ told everyone knew one senior staff found Are guys upset MS SANDERS I ’ asked specifically.Matthew.Q Thanks Sarah Raj day said last week situation could handled better Yesterday echoed said situation could handled better Today Chief Staff said done right Can explain — White House think Rob Porter situation could handled differently Or guys think

MS SANDERS She part lot conversations took place I ’ recall room able say specifically comments made ’ make She ’ White House Communications Director important valuable member staff done great job role.Steve.Q Was discussion promoting Rob Porter another job time blew MS SANDERS Not I ’ aware I — I ’ know answer that.Jeff.Q Sarah said FBI said completed late July said follow-up required fieldwork Was something Rob Porter said response allegations ’ true Or required fieldwork follow-up MS SANDERS I ’ know specifics I refer back previous statement.Q If I could ask though In op-ed morning Washington Post first wife Rob Porter said specifically “ I expected woman better. ” Based know believe personally misled And regret explained American people MS SANDERS Look I said best job every single day I would never presume understand anything going individual would I think could presume ’ going way I ’ responding.Look ’ condemned domestic violence every way possible In fact President ’ budget released yesterday fully funds Violence Against Women Act We ’ looking ways take action help prevent ever happening anyone And presume I feel differently simply strong mischaracterization I White House actions focused ’ trying here.Q If I could ask one —MS SANDERS Sorry I ’ going keep moving Joe.Q — John Kelly stand sit today terms — President confidence confidence

Again I ’ aware I ’ say 100 percent certainty I ’ aware conversations individuals.Q And looking ways could change process senior official White House facing credible allegations spousal abuse criminal charge senior staff would notified timely way I mean appears — timeline accurate — taken year.MS SANDERS Look I think process law enforcement intelligence community weigh determine changes made way ’ carried out.Q I ’ talking process I ’ talking process — investigation serious allegations could surface nobody West Wing would aware that.MS SANDERS But would include agencies departments So ’ exclude conversation changes need made program.I think would something involved stakeholders something certainly far beyond purview walk today.Q Just following Julie asking You ’ saying law enforcement weigh ’ White House ’ charge process Should weigh take —MS SANDERS It ’ actually process A large number background component run FBI Other intelligence agencies weigh in.Again I said stakeholders part discussion looked determined whether changes need made process.Q Given impacts White House staff want request improved process MS SANDERS Again would go beyond scope I walk today I think ’ certainly

investigation question Porter ’ background check March completed background investigation late July.And yesterday I asking White House Counsel learned Mr. Porter learned report Daily Mail last week reply “ process background ongoing White House received specific papers regarding completion background check. ” So two statements — FBI Director ’ statement Mr. Wray statement yesterday seemed odds one another Do see anything ’ like clarify terms I asked today based upon answer yesterday MS SANDERS Yeah I said earlier understanding information would gone personnel security office That office completed process order make recommendation adjudication White House That still ongoing therefore recommendation made.Q But said specific papers regarding completion background check received.MS SANDERS That ’ part process White House Personnel Security Office plays run career officials ’ received recommendation office.Q And yet FBI Director said today oath completed background investigation actually submitted late July So one MS SANDERS Let read The White House Personnel Security Office staffed career officials received information last year considered final background investigation report November But made final recommendation adjudication White House process still ongoing Porter resigned.In view Personnel Security Office FBI ’ July report required significant additional
