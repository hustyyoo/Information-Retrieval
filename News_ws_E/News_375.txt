ATTORNEY GENERAL SESSIONS Big star.THE PRESIDENT Pretty big star I think best Right MS CONWAY Thank sir I ’ see way.THE PRESIDENT Would like say something Because I know ’ important issue personally.MS CONWAY Yes sir Yes sir Thank yesterday today And one thing I would mention heard mayor walked room heard Mr. Scott yesterday — whose daughter Rachel Joy Scott first fatality Columbine 19 years ago — lack connectedness youth And social media outlets ’ mentioned ’ even exist 1999 But ’ lack connectedness I think ’ whole type stigma silence needs cured society.We role play ’ entire spectrum actors We watch words actions realize many different causes symptoms consequences obviously.But time ’ focusing youth need focus youth ability feel connected That respect one individual It ’ I heard clearly Mr. Scott yesterday clearly mayor clearly President United States moments ago.Thank much leader Mr. President I think great opportunity join nation help heal move forward way shows resilience great resolve talk action We ’ grateful ’ President time.THE PRESIDENT Thank Thank much Kellyanne.Patrick.MR NEVILLE Mr. President Patrick Neville Colorado House Minority Leader also former Columbine student day.Thank leadership issue You ’ absolutely right — I read comments last night find way let good people defend students We ’ let criminals think going easy target enter schools injure students We find way harden targets students ’ sitting ducks.Furthermore I think good programs model The Safe Tell program Colorado wildly successful We similar Pam Bondi talking It used school violence actions also used suicidal ideations things nature.But said I think immediately I think also need realize ’ guns My experience pretty unique Columbine also two propane tanks supposed bomb going go By grace God ’ happen But ways people commit atrocious acts.So I appreciate approach listening reacting.THE PRESIDENT Well I appreciate ’ saying And I ’ watched read great story came — ’ fantastically well right now.But I happen agree We harden schools soften A gun-free zone killer somebody wants killer ’ like going ice cream That ’ like “ Here I take me. ” We get smart gun-free zones When see says “ This gun-free zone ” means nobody gun except nobody going shooting bullets direction And see beautiful target They live gun-free zones.And I mean frankly teachers Marines 20 years retire become teacher And ’ Army Navy Air Force ’ Coast Guard ’ people shooting contests And ’ whatever — They know guns understand guns.And I frankly reading lot And I think allow person Marines 20 years ’ done nothing handle guns handle safely well — ’ give teacher gun.One fake news networks CNN last night saying I want teachers guns I ’ want teachers guns I want certain highly adept people people understand weaponry guns — really aptitude Because everybody aptitude gun But aptitude I think concealed permit — teachers letting people know people building gun — ’ — opinion ’ shootings Because people cowards They ’ going walk school 20 percent teachers guns It may 10 percent may 40 percent.And I would recommend people carry give bonus We give little bit bonus Frankly ’ feel comfortable gun anyway But give little bit bonus.So practically free made school hardened target For instance coaches I guarantee plenty experience weapons — guns — need hard matter keep gun-free ’ able get ’ crawl back window something And ’ going everybody without protection.So I know stand You want hardened school I want hardened school I want know get ’ going long Because ’ going take 10 minutes police get The police incredible job getting I guess averages eight minutes shootings average three minutes And ’ tremendous destruction death.So I would like see true people great talent guns adept guns ’ percentage people But whatever percentage may ’ substantial number Because ’ hire enough security guards You ’ hire — I mean school — school example Christine would — ’ need 100 150 security guards That big school tremendous floor area You ’ many — wants many security guards standing place loaded guns But could concealed teachers They ’ know — people — nobody would know And tremendous threat And way instead advertising “ This school guns We gun-free ” let people know opposite Nobody going attack school believe Because ’ cowards They ’ want shot And ’ going shot at.So everybody agrees us — I know stand — lot people agree us But I think need hardened sites We need let people know You come schools ’ going dead ’ going fast And unless ’ going always problem You talk gun-free zones We case three years ago military base five Marines I believe three world-class shots experts guns told gun-free area — within military base believe that.If ’ trust military going trust You know I ’ saying Five They putting away — put away guns Their guns different section totally gun-free Their guns 250 yards away store And went lunch wacko came shot five He ’ lasted one — three people world-class marksmen He ’ lasted second But stood nothing could All five killed You know instance I ’ talking That gun-free zone military base.Well school frankly different I want schools protected like banks protected like everything else And I get kick — I watching politician weak ineffective politician last night — I ’ tell name I ’ want embarrass anybody — talking guns And yet ’ surrounded three guys carrying guns I said “ Well going give guns ” They ’ going give guns But wants everybody else guns And plenty them.So harden sites We careful And people adept may — go training I would say every six months every year They fairly — really rigorous course ’ And paid extra money Those teachers paid extra money So get bonus ’ love getting bonus And would much less expensive guards It ’ look bad You know guards looks like armed camp would look terrible Because people telling ’ going put lot security guards buildings Will look terrible And would much effective.But I ’ tell harden sites way way similar fashion — teachers coaches could people work building — harden sites ’ going problem guys lack courage never go schools Those schools going safe.But say school gun-free — ’ got guns nothing ’ gun-free — boy start — ’ want hear So I agree Patrick Strongly agree you.MR KITTLE Fred Kittle Bartow County schools Bartow County Georgia.First mom ’ whoop thank March 29th — veterans She Vietnam widow uncle wounded veteran former police chief inaudible City.What ’ — I got thank Clarence Robie ph DNS ph ’ — know school boards regular jobs side.But one things ’ school system — Georgia given school boards lot power And absolutely correct ’ things local already We single point entry schools You buzzed get We resource officers And like said would take quite bit — I believe ’ seven school And 13,332 students 892 teachers there.But also work really closely law enforcement For example one middle schools elementary — police station right around corner And pay sheriff ’ department local police help people coming going traffic But ’ also ’ ’ present So ’ also deterrent.THE PRESIDENT How many school Because sheriff ’ department ’ enough people really take care school That ’ problem.MR KITTLE You ’ absolutely correct Now ’ something state Georgia last shootings 2014 giving school systems authority We ’ allowed — school board votes actually armed employees They go safety firearm training resource officers also go third party — another party training year.So ’ absolutely correct And done And I think lot need address heart problem — heart issue You know one things comes family We come community faith-based community wants help When tornadoes hit Adairsville FEMA thought going long time Very short People volunteered came chainsaws right happened And send back get power gas that.But ’ allowed faith-based lot Right ’ trying figure help us kinds ways But separation church state never intended So would appreciate keep electing — electing — appointing justices like ’ follow Constitution inaudible .THE PRESIDENT We ’ great success appointment justices ’ true judges.MR KITTLE And I need say ’ fuss But lot people praying administration Georgia We quite churches We group called President ’ Team Once week pray all.THE PRESIDENT Thank you.MR KITTLE They ’ praying community I know may sound — devastation I ’ imagine I ’ got six kids I ’ imagine losing In fact watching — I love ’ everybody discuss talk solution You ’ solving things hear politicians 30 years ’ within year And really appreciate it.And ’ kind taken motto “ Just job. ” And works phenomenally Because ’ one person responsible know comes on.THE PRESIDENT Well I want politicians watch Like yesterday importantly watched lot saw And saw devastation ’ caused And know maybe ’ know ’ get see I mean I families families devastated.And I want politicians see pass legislation They things And I ’ biggest believer Second Amendment Okay I biggest But I ’ tell I spoke NRA — top people And I spoke gave tremendous support — tremendous I think I earliest — I probably earliest one Kellyanne I hear ever You know endorsed absolute earliest point could And I ’ believer.But I spoke ’ ready things They want things You know ’ good people They ’ patriots They love country But NRA ready things And know people like blame power But want — want — actually came certain rules regulations But ’ going toughen — I told I said ’ going toughen Because ’ make anybody look good importantly I saw devastation families We ’ allow happen.But need hardened school But want harden without everybody standing rifle I ’ want either ’ good That sends lot bad signals As example I ’ watching John Kelly — General John Kelly So ’ four-star Marine He ’ tough cookie If teacher I ’ mind gun I guarantee use better anybody There ’ security guard ’ going hire ’ going handle gun better So ’ teacher friends Marines ’ teaching — people like — I want gun.But importantly — almost importantly nobody going attack school Because know General Kelly history teacher He ’ teaching win wars okay And ’ got concealed weapon But ’ going know ’ got concealed tell bullets going flying direction You ’ going attacks that.If ’ going continue nonsense gun-free zone — gun-free sounds good It ’ like — sounds great It target killer They look gun-free zones believe ’ want get killed.MR KITTLE And soft target movie theaters that.THE PRESIDENT Well look guy Florida He tried escape Right You great policeman caught different community But actually escaped He ’ want get shot If would known going shot — ’ coward — tried escape He actually escape They great policeman different community found So ’ need.MR KITTLE One board members ask ask however ’ looking solutions — know kids precious need whatever need — time one things hurts systems lot come unfunded mandates We ’ suddenly something ’ necessarily money So something federal level would like make sure ’ funded ’ already go different block schedule cost us 30 teachers And ’ want —THE PRESIDENT You know ’ much funding This common sense I mean money ’ talking — I mean I ’ talking going save money Everybody agrees hard — ’ talking 50 security guards standing school know going nice students.I ’ talking something ’ anyway get little extra money happen carry go training every year I mean ’ talking rules regulations purchasing We ’ talking changing age 18 21.I mean buy revolver — handgun — buy age 21 And yet weapons talk — people ’ like — ’ allowed buy 18 So make sense How make sense So I say 21.But ’ talking money We ’ talking common sense ’ great thing And NRA back I really feel confident NRA back Congress Senate.MR KITTLE I really like ’ focused tool ’ also focusing like mental illness issues families —THE PRESIDENT No focus mental illness You got focus mental illness ’ big factor But addition mental illness harden schools make sure — way ’ look like ’ hardened But let bad guy know hardened There ’ going news And ’ want secret So come ’ going last long You ’ going problem.Betsy thank you.SECRETARY DEVOS Thank Mr. President Thank much leadership The session yesterday difficult moving important I really appreciate focus protection also prevention And I think particularly issue connectedness I think teachers tools give practices daily weekly bi-weekly.I heard great story teacher following Columbine every two weeks asks students make list five students ’ like sit next week five students might like sit And simple act regularly done able detect pattern ’ child outside And simple practice implemented tomorrow today.So I really — heart goes teachers cases feel powerless But I think help empower tools —THE PRESIDENT Good.SECRETARY DEVOS — notice things.THE PRESIDENT Thanks Betsy Thank you.SECRETARY DEVOS
