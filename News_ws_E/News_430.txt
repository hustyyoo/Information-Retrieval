DIRECTOR MULVANEY No end day I ’ this.It probably would taken us April — maybe March April maybe May — fully incorporate happened Friday ’ 19 budget And even today numbers going see exactly precise Not say ’ good numbers really really solid numbers But things would literally take us weeks sort work mathematical calculations order get ultimate impact.An example sake discussion deal Friday extended mandatory sequester two years It ’ really hard figure impact 10 years road.So numbers really solid numbers They ’ exact would taken three four months crunch through.So I ’ going go ’ 18 I ’ going go ’ 19 I ’ going deal front question everybody wants ask — I ’ know would ’ gotten chance ask first — dead arrival That ’ popular question everybody asks In fact asking morning television And answer absolutely It simply highlights fact messaging document The executive budget always messaging document.What messages year There ’ two primary messages Number one ’ spend money Congress But would prefer see spend That message number one I ’ explain couple minutes.And message trillion-dollar deficits forever And become really apparent walk two things.So I bring please slide number one I ’ going show ’ done ’ 18 budget okay This budget folks saw back springtime spending levels defense non-defense discretionary All right We changed order accommodate happened Friday night By way ’ forget people actually two government shutdowns believe not.So went ahead President ’ approval — fact direction — went ahead spent everything 2018 exception OCO We moved money non-defense discretionary OCO — Overseas Contingency Operations — mostly State Department — OCO onto base budget.But part went ahead spent Congress said wanted spend ’ 18 So appropriations process start Remember bill passed Friday really spend money next year It spent money programs so-forth came funding government ’ 18 appropriations bill All set spending caps appropriations bill needs pass CR expires end March.So us weighing debate If going spend money Congress going — would like see spend it.So go slide two ’ go changes made get old ’ 18 budget ’ 18 budget sending back Hill today And I ’ make clear — sent bunch stuff Hill today addition ’ 19 base budget sent addendum changes ’ 19 budget — I ’ talk second — also notes take old ’ 18 budget get this.Everybody knows defense We spent 26 billion extra defense get us level talked inaudible discussion — 700 billion last year For ’ 18 — year.An increase budget last year 117 billion The big pieces puzzle follows see 34.5 billion infrastructure That includes first piece infrastructure bill President rolled Marc Keep mind talk 200 billion program That ’ 200 billion year one ’ 200 billion year five ’ phased several years And ’ said “ Okay ’ going raise caps 2018 let ’ go ahead spend 20 billion administration ’ infrastructure initiative.We added another 15.7 billion border security bringing us 18 billion border wall across things What mean That means ’ anticipating DACA deal All right We fully anticipate getting type deal DACA would provide building entire southern border infrastructure goes That ’ 18 billion Most ’ ’ 18 You ’ see ’ 19 added money ’ added back additional border security.We added 3 billion opioids I ’ talk minutes We also add bunch money ’ 19 opioids People say “ Well spent ” — number ’ 19 way 10 billion — say “ Well spending 3 billion year 10 billion next year ” The answer — keep mind ’ — time pass deal — appropriations deal March pass one March ’ going Six months left fiscal year So ’ ’ 18 left spend money.So spent 3 billion opioids IT modernization big priority President ’ get lot attention It ’ one boring non-glamorous things government trying update IT.R D — big plus-up R D In fact talked last year — ’ talk ’ 19 year — total R D spending actually increases budgets Our ’ 19 budget bigger ’ 17 ’ 18 budget bigger ’ 17 Which reminds way — one little wrinkles ’ sort hard follow — talk today increases last year — I talk ’ 19 I compare ’ 17.I ’ say I talk ’ 19 compared last year ’ 17 Why Because ’ 18 spending levels ’ set yet We ’ still operating CR And caps set ’ 18 Congress yet appropriate within subcategories money ’ going spent many spent programmatic level.So hear say “ NASA gets X number billion dollars last year ” ’ compared ’ 17 enacted exactly reason.We ’ moved bunch like I said money OCO bases primarily State Department Keep mind OCO budget used several years way get around caps Many us believe fact Republicans Democrats believe abused misused order get around caps We took advantage additional money go ahead fix problem permanently moved money OCO base Add 17.7 billion budget gimmicks.For really geeky want talk CHIMPs talk afterwards But part plug lot old smoke mirrors budgets typically use try stay within caps And 23.8 billion spread bunch different things.Q What Can explain —DIRECTOR MULVANEY The 23.8 billion Q Yeah.DIRECTOR MULVANEY It ’ long list I think ’ going — going produce list ’ 18 add-backs detail We ’ 19.Q Can give us highlights It ’ there.DIRECTOR MULVANEY Honestly — I honestly ’ front I apologize But yes get details 23.8 billion is.Q But ’ non-defense Yes DIRECTOR MULVANEY This non-defense yeah.Q Okay.DIRECTOR MULVANEY The defense This non-defense.Keep mind across every single part government could small amounts There ’ lot them.All right ’ ’ 18 So took old budget springtime added 26 billion defense 117 billion non-defense ’ sent Hill say “ Okay going spend money would prefer see spend it. ” Obviously administration ’ priorities infrastructure opioids southern border wall — types things Not going surprise anybody.If I go next slide I ’ start talking ’ 19 This working last week Because cap caps deal last Friday So ’ working past half year wrote budget.On Friday raised caps As sat try figure would ’ 19 decided spend it.Again go back message — one two topline messages If ’ going spend — spend like ’ ’ 18 — ’ spend These spending caps They spending floors.And sat looked administration ’ priorities ’ think necessary spend way order fund government order fund priorities.So let ’ talk going going next slide please.All right So see added money — I ’ got details I details give second And I paper I numbers folks —Q Can answer couple questions defense spending DIRECTOR MULVANEY I try But keep questions end would lot easier.Russ got long list additions ’ 19 budget chance Yeah thanks That ’ one.So ’ 19 — ’ hit highlights ’ 19 budget You see graphically But plussed Agriculture — 192 billion Department Education went 3.3 billion — excuse 192 million Ag — 3.3 billion Education The biggest piece Pell program We ’ talk second.Department Energy went 1.5 billion This budget working caps deal cut The Department Energy ’ Office Science went 1.2 billion.Health Human Services got biggest piece Health Human Services — 15.8 billion HHS The biggest chunk NIH You remember I came last year I tried present proposed 9 billion reduction NIH grants I think went 35 billion 26 billion We put back in.I learned really valuable lesson last year Not Congress like proposed NIH cuts last year made illegal year.Remember last year I came I said look want reduce spending NIH way want forcing programs look administrative costs Because could get administrative costs actually pay administrative costs private grants could cut 9 billion spending get exact amount research Do remember conversation I certainly do.Congress passed appropriations bill April said going plus back 35-odd billion dollars whatever put rider said law spend money analyses administrative costs So prevented us law trying save money.So I learned lesson said “ Okay got extra money spend. ” We put another 9 billion NIH makes big piece 15.8 billion Another 5 billion opioids We ’ talk second.Health Human Services went another 11 billion Another 5 billion opioids The opioids money split two different pieces HHS health centers get big chunk — 5.7 billion.Homeland 1.5 billion Department Housing Urban Development 2 billion including another billion elderly disabled tenant rent contributions Interior 340 million Justice 12 billion That mostly CHIMP use CHIMP Crime Victims Fund sort push — smoke mirrors Again care talk offline.Labor 1.5 billion State 1.5 billion Primarily ’ State The International Humanitarian Assistance ’ plussed 1 billion.Transportation 300 million inaudible Veteran ’ Affairs 2.4 billion — going Veterans Choice Program additional 1.9 billion.EPA 724 million NASA 300 million We talk detail.By way good place stop say look I know ’ throwing bunch information I know ’ way last year ’ coming day one coming back next day on-the-record hearing I go Hill tomorrow Senate tomorrow morning House that.So I recognize fact ’ get chance probably get granular questions want But could reach John Czwartacki ’ make time individual basis go specific questions specific line items.I ask — I ’ done yet In fact I ’ close done yet.I ask start writing stuff say ’ funding “ X ” year please check us make sure ’ using right number Because many numbers floating I ’ hate somebody write article talks ignores fact spent bunch money program wrote there.So big additions ’ 19 Let ’ go slide five please Talk macro — oh highlights talking Defense goes — non-defense I ’ going come back couple details second.Actually let ’ Let ’ Let ’ talk things ’ got We ’ talked defense You folks see — ’ 716 billion FY19 This full request Department Defense By way call “ 050 function. ” That national defense writ large The actual DOD number 670 billion something like something like that.Because keep mind defense functions Defense Department So see allocation actual Department Defense ’ equal 716 billion ’ — example Department Energy handles nuclear weapons So part goes And ’ couple programs.STAFF MEMBER 686 billion .DIRECTOR MULVANEY 686 billion total But take national defense — call “ 050 function ” way appropriate Hill — 716 billion General Mattis talks And everybody knows ’ case So ’ like ’ hiding ball that.No believe I ’ done yet.Drug prices Some really really good stuff go President ’ priorities year Again ’ funding — ’ increased funding ’ focused ’ 19 President ’ priorities We ’ talked defense We ’ talked infrastructure I could talk lot I know folks already — questions I think ’ got details already infrastructure.Drug prices This probably stuff folks seeing first time I really excited President actually put State Union Address I one people — I got chance see full speech And started fairly long speech got whittled whittled whittled And see drug prices made final draft big plus I thought.You ’ going see major commitment administration additional spending reforms get drug prices year The FDA looking total increase 1 billion That ’ almost 22 percent increase ’ 17 enacted.This one primary examples spending money things work Scott Gottlieb shown absolute ability increase flow generics market save money This administration save seniors 300 million year already work FDA done generics.So ’ going see major commitment us increase spending FDA try increase flow generics increase approval new drugs exactly President talked campaign get regulatory hurdles drug approvals get drugs market faster.On Medicaid ’ got couple changes Medicaid drive drug prices One ones talk way — Inspector General actually found bunch examples drugs mistreated branded drugs generic cost us absolute fortune.We ’ going try — ’ proposing budget change rules make clear things like EpiPen lot cheaper Keep mind ’ one largest purchasers drugs United States In fact I think government probably Medicaid VA Medicare.So figure way save money programs like goes straight bottom line critically without reducing anybody ’ benefits.When talk Medicare talk Medicaid today — I ’ going finish talking Part D stuff — talking things lower drug prices save money folks programs We talking single instance denying anybody coverage raising anybody ’ age means testing.It ’ message heard last year The President willing promises made campaign trail deal entitlement programs But I think I make case figuring way get drug prices absolutely consistent campaign promises.We ’ also going try clarify Medicaid definition brand versus over-the-counter drugs biologics — oh interesting — ’ giving states — ’ giving five states within Medicaid test program allow try limit formulary negotiate drug prices.People always ask time “ Why ’ negotiate drug prices ” Well always going admit every — every drug world formulary negotiating prices ’ anything people know take drug end day And able limit formulary — drugs cover — order negotiation make sense effect all.So ’ proposing Medicaid test program five states — allow want limit formulary negotiate drug prices own.Q Are talking inelastic versus elastic DIRECTOR MULVANEY No I ’ Come Give chance —Q Okay I asking.DIRECTOR MULVANEY All right Good No.Part D — talk Part D proposals A couple different things As many know follow healthcare industry lot manufacturers provide rebates various health plans But seniors rarely ever see So senior paying pocket ’ really impacted rebate One proposals least one-third rebates passed purchasers point sale It ’ going impact lowering out-of-pocket costs folks Medicare.We ’ establishing true — first time — true out-of-pocket cap seniors Once start lowering prices Right ’ incentive drug companies try rush people doughnut hole get catastrophic government picks big chunks cost And ’ trying figure way — ’ actually proposing ways get rid incentives.And one favorites ’ limiting amount raise prices within Medicare I think Part B Part D. But right — I idea — I take drug onto formulary Medicare ’ 100 next year I ’ limit amount raise price In fact I ’ much limit And drugs actually get expensive stay formulary longer absolutely crazy That ’ business I know products get expensive longer ’ market.So one things ’ ’ limiting increases prices actual cost inflation That saves us tremendous amount money.Lastly within — well ’ couple — last thing drug prices 340B program I think getting little bit attention I saw ads television Right ’ folks game system There ’ folks ’ There ’ companies — health providers ’ provide charity care ’ take advantage 340B program And ’ buy small private providers provide charity care ’ take advantage apply 340B treatment entire system Did I get right Grogan MR GROGAN Yep.DIRECTOR MULVANEY Good.All right ’ lot things ’ drug prices Opioids 3 billion last year 10 billion year On top I think ’ couple hundred million dollars — ’ 100 million us pilot program ’ trying NIH specifically get private industry participate research get us non-addictive pain — pain replacement opioids One interesting things I think ’ come — excited work.SNAP Food stamps A couple changes We ’ hit highlights You may heard already Food Box Program One innovative things — actually I think originated USDA Secretary Perdue wanted give chance We thought tremendous idea propose folks food stamps — part — part benefits come actually sort — I ’ want steal somebody ’ copyright — Blue Apron-type program actually receive food instead receive cash It lowers cost us buy prices wholesale whereas buy retail It also makes sure ’ getting nutritious food So ’ pretty excited That ’ tremendous cost savings.We ’ also — contained within SNAP lot welfare programs — lot able-bodied work requirements ’ heard us talk last year year Repeal replace Obamacare — ’ fine talk We talk welfare reform ’ mostly focused able-boded adults Medicare talked Drug prices.That farm bill subsidy last year try limit subsidies farmers adjusted-gross incomes less 500,000 — AGI less 500,000 Not orderly year still going cover 98 percent farmers I point farm friends bad year AGI drop 500,000 would qualify benefits forth.So hits highlights 2019 If I go next slide — I ’ almost done I promise Macro get lot We ’ changed macroeconomic assumptions last year slightly would imagine Here would — assumptions last year GDP growth Remember 2.3 2.5 2.8 ramped 3.0 percent Yes I take pleasure realizing lot accused crazy I said that.Q Why point Laughter DIRECTOR MULVANEY Because think I ’ crazy anyway Laughter So like remember —Q That ’ mean ’ love you.DIRECTOR MULVANEY I mean listen I ’ take 15 seconds pat back We even better I mean people thought crazy introduce 2.3 last year blew water I ’ wait go Senate House hearings talk friends including old buddy Chris Van Hollen said craziest thing ’ ever seen.We beat number last year So I think ’ completely reasonable us ramp things little bit We came 3.1 3.2 think — obviously think hit numbers You notice towards end tail instead maintaining 3 percent way across That — CEA driven — ’ part normal business cycles We ’ expect actually stay 3 percent whole way.On interest rates two different ways The 90-day Treasury 10-year Treasury We came little bit 90 little bit 10-year think ’ reality looked like.So CPI thing We thought ’ see inflation little bit higher We continue see So ’ adjusted inflation little bit couple years You see “ years ” lot numbers almost entirely same.The unemployment numbers similarly — experience years ’ worth — belts — rates trending little bit lower expected.Keep mind end missing — lot folks say “ Well Mulvaney happens end interest rate next year 3.6 ” Well one primary driving reasons would GDP number actually higher expect Keep mind one point increase GDP 10-year window roughly 3.25 trillion deficit.One additional point across ten years takes deficit 3.25 trillion Yes interest rate 100 basis points 1 percentage point costs us 1.5 1.6 trillion year But long ’ got GDP growing fast ’ got interest rates deficit going down.Lastly ’ shown folks going ask impact tax bill revenues And yeah ’ going see spike deficit originally expected year — tax revenues going down.But analysis already shows 10 years — I ’ slide one got one afternoon — 10 years actually — generating money Treasury CBO baseline — written tax bill.So tax bill actually generate additional saving additional revenue Treasury ’ without In fact last year budget CBO baseline line — ’ generating almost 400 billion extra every single year tax bill growth assumptions growth ’ already experienced And number continues get bigger future.You increased deficits first five years revenues down.All right lastly I go slide seven please All right question right — balance No ’ t.I said last year — fact I want get right — I interview last year Washington Examiner said “ The longer wait make reforms spending proposals made last year ’ budget harder gets actually balance. ” That ’ I ’ think would able balance budget next year unless actually make changes year proposed And ’ In fact ’ make hardly proposals.I think ’ probably — sent 54 billion worth savings last year Hill took 5 billion worth They ’ make large structural changes proposed.And listen I probably could made balance would rightly absolutely excoriated us using funny numbers would taken funny numbers it.These real numbers We lot fewer plugs year mostly better data Remember last year transition budget We lot fewer plugs year We lot support numbers These numbers good numbers And I ’ proud work folks OMB done give us solid numbers But I ’ come tell using solid numbers balance 10 years ’ t.And I think ’ — I hope ’ value honest people fiscal situation But ’ balance 10-year window What however ’ able turn tide turn trajectory especially measure GDP — debt percentage GDP We peak 80 percent ’ 20 ’ 21 ’ 22 We get way.If I could go next slide please And see difference ’ proposing budget think real world looks like The real world blue budget orange.What second message document The first message You ’ spend spend The second message We condemned trillion-dollar deficits forever There way By way okay without changing Medicare — least benefits people get Medicare We ’ always talked drug stuff without changing major parts Medicare without changing Social Security retirement.There way get treadmill trillion-dollar deficits take spending side extraordinarily seriously.The budget — I ’ close — budget represents 3 trillion savings course 10 years It ’ second largest proposed reduction spending ever second last year ’ budget It ’ 1.7 billion mandatory savings I think —STAFF MEMBER Trillion.DIRECTOR MULVANEY 1.7 trillion Excuse 3 trillion total savings 10 years 1.7 — 1.7 trillion mandatory I think largest ever.So President — one say President ’ take seriously We sort resigning trillion-dollar deficits forever He making tough choices ’ smart way still allow us fund priorities run country see tremendous economic growth.With I ’ take questions Yes sir.Q You talked little bit budget winners Potentially would budget losers DIRECTOR MULVANEY How would define loser My guess loser would program ’ work.Let ’ give example Workforce — I forgot talk workforce It priority us I ’ make screen I apologize In workforce classic example try set budget The winners apprenticeship programs The losers things like Trade Adjustment Assistance okay We reform TAA Why Because ’ seem work In fact data seems suggest folks go program actually end lower-paying jobs folks ’ go program okay So ’ program screams either less spending reform both.The flipside apprenticeship programs actually hard data says people go apprenticeship programs actually come pay better jobs backend And reason double funding within FY19 budget apprenticeship programs.So answer question losers — use word — programs ’ work anymore.Yes sir.Q I wanted ask — mentioned budget — civil service reform It uses term “ Hire best fire worst. ” How hard administration going push terms —DIRECTOR MULVANEY Thanks ’ make high level presentation The proposal hiring best firing worst works like You ’ going see propose civilian pay raise year Instead ’ done ’ set 1 billion fund idea towards giving managers ability pay people whose performance actually merits increase opposed giving folks automatic increases I ’ remember numbers top head ’ high 90s federal workers get automatic performance-based increases every single year.STAFF MEMBER 99.7 percent .DIRECTOR MULVANEY 99.7 Like I said ’ —Q 91 —DIRECTOR MULVANEY It ’ 99.7 automatically get performance-based increases every year I think ’ fair say maybe ’ true performance-based indicator.And ’ like simply say look one folks really good government worker get raise If ’ ’ In fact internal studies government level point one top complaints federal workers job pay tied performance And see folks know ’ pulling weight getting increases folks pulling weight getting ’ frustrating them.So one biggest things ’ trying management — “ M ” side OMB — remember “ M ” Office Management Budget — change way hire fire But point specifically pay.I ’ go second I promised young lady next question.Q Thank I want go back You addressed little bit I want go back claim administration tax reform bill would wind paying This year though looks like revenues — revenues sharply lower If look last year ’ revenue baseline 2018 ’ 27 almost 47 trillion But plug year ’ baseline years equals 3.7 trillion less How work DIRECTOR MULVANEY Yeah A couple different things First ’ asked sort two different questions The idea tax bill reaping benefits long period thing also said impacts year.But let ’ look long period ’ absolutely right 3.7 trillion difference And talking Treasury — ’ getting guidance tonight I understand Treasury — breaks follows About 1.4 trillion Treasury calls technical adjustments These adjustments Treasury makes formulas methodology every single year.And tell get detail Treasury evening Mnuchin — Steven Mnuchin I testifying week ’ data — 1.4 trillion changes would take place without tax bill Okay So take part 3.7 throw 1.4 away.Half trillion dollars assume individuals tax rates extended cuts individuals rates extended throughout budget window And costs additional half trillion dollars So ’ technical bill Right The bill — talked fact bill written way score certain manner CBO But said good policies Those policies stay place.The last — difference 1.8 1.9 trillion life program deals Treasury scores believe Obamacare repeal portion tax bill taxes But I ’ let Treasury fill later tonight.In back please.Q You talk —DIRECTOR MULVANEY No wait please You ’ always yelled everybody else raises hands So wait —Q I raising hand.Q I want go back ’ talked interest rates inflation possibly moving lower Where seems — know lot market turmoil last week concern moving higher — interest rates inflation So I ’ wondering worried bond market point kind forcing hand forcing spending cuts able go spending plans have.DIRECTOR MULVANEY Yeah well traditional — orthodox answer macroeconomic position would yeah ’ supposed concerned Right Every time ’ going — see GDP go borrowing go see interest rates go up.The fact matter though aside little spike ’ last 10 days ’ seen long time In fact follow economic literature ’ see one great topics debate amongst macroeconomists world around right “ Where inflation ” We ’ growth place ’ seen inflation.I could opine might I mean maybe labor markets lot slacker numbers would indicate Maybe labor force participation rate come good bit without creating inflation Maybe ’ supply-side type inflation ’ lead type inflationary —Q But ’ making assumptions —DIRECTORY MULVANEY Well yeah You — look let ’ perfectly clear We make assumptions There ’ question All ’ done ’ made assumptions think defensible last year ’ adjusted order account additional year ’ worth data So absolutely stand economic assumptions.Yes ’ am.Q Yes said 10 years budget ’ balance But see balancing ever DIRECTOR MULVANEY We stopped 10 years And philosophical conversation I could come today say well ’ balance 10 years balances 17 27 37 I think might undermine credibility numbers And goal give American people give Congress real numbers And ’ stopped 10 years.Do follow-up Q Yeah one additional question You mentioned amount — 18 billion put aside border wall —DIRECTOR MULVANEY Yeah.Q — based DACA deal What ’ DACA deal Does mean border wall money DIRECTOR MULVANEY Then Congress never give us money.Q So border wall money unless ’ DACA deal DIRECTOR MULVANEY Well There ’ two different pieces Thank clarification.No ’ hardwired appropriations process 1.6 billion ’ 18 I think 3 billion —STAFF MEMBER 1.6 billion again.DIRECTOR MULVANEY 1.6 billion ’ 19 Okay And goes back — ’ — 1.6 billion ’ 19 since last year And ’ want border wall regardless DACA.Now President already said comprehensive immigration deal DACA deal part deal must fully securing southern border And ’ 18 25 billion comes play.Q But 25 billion — ’ said want.DIRECTOR MULVANEY Yeah I think look — number changed couple different times — I think 25 billion border security including wall I think bricks-and-mortar component 18 billion .Yes ’ am.Q Two questions A technical one philosophical one First Medicaid Medicare talked savings — seems lot payment savings — tell us total savings number would Is 236 billion Is larger number And second administration chooses fully spend money allowed caps sending message particularly conservative members House ’ support spending bills spend money therefore making harder continue regular order appropriations Congress ’ able nearly decade.DIRECTOR MULVANEY Okay let answer first one first I think ’ shorter one The answer 236 billion I ’ heard number today media half billion something like ’ right It ’ 236 billion The stuff stuff simply moved spending Medicare trust fund fund someplace else.The two biggest examples — believe — I ’ know year I ’ know folks know Do know Medicare — pay FICA every single month money goes pay graduate medical school tuition I idea case Okay And stopped used monies pay That ’ part 500.Another thing Medicare money goes pay every single year bad debts incurred hospitals non-Medicare patients So I go hospital I get treatment — I ’ Medicare — I ’ pay bill Medicare pay cost hospital.We ’ think right We thought contributing early decline Medicare trust fund So changed programs We fund base okay So real number reduced spending Medicare 236 billion Did I get right Good.Now keep mind manage part fairly modest changes — fact — oh way I — yeah go ahead Can go next slide real quick Okay This talked Okay These ones talk — spending removed trust funds stuff And Medicare-specific proposal That ’ 236 billion I talked Okay With modest reforms within — produce So guys ’ worry taking pictures ’ want to.Q Okay.DIRECTOR MULVANEY But modest reforms believe extend viability Medicare trust fund eight years Okay That ’ — easy fix ’ critical fix things If go back I ’ move next topic If go back previous slide Thank you.Now sending message vote No The message clear Okay Keep mind two numbers ’ 18 ’ 19 almost exactly The difference caps 10 billion Okay So message really simple You ’ spend something happens appropriations bills — face ’ kidding There going appropriations bills passed Congress They ’ going another omni right But something happens next omni next CR say wait second maybe concerned deficit — maybe ’ want spend money — something shelf go look say look could do.However decide want spend — ’ ’ 19 budget — want spend want know administration ’ priorities spending ’ got ’ 18 budget look at.Yes sir.Q As one-time deficit hawk simply —DIRECTOR MULVANEY No still-time deficit hawk Thank you.Q Okay well I think adds even question How say hypocritical DIRECTOR MULVANEY Did I tell story NIH I mean spends money You know question Who spends — appropriates money I set budget — know ’ answer Who appropriates money Q The Congress.DIRECTOR MULVANEY That ’ exactly right And I ’ sorry sit Acosta ’ seat I ask Acosta question You know sent 54 billion worth reductions last year took 5 billion pounded hell right So I mean I know attitude Hill And ’ wanted send budgets We ’ love see spend less Okay The President tweeted weekend accept bunch additional non-defense discretionary spending order get defense spending wanted He said accept bunch waste extra spending order get That ’ ideal If left President United States ’ fund defense If President United States ’ talked 2019 budget.So I think one things really surprised caps discussion Democrats would look eye say “ We want fund defense too. ” And every time said “ I ’ like dollar defense ” said “ Well give give us dollar here. ” And I think really surprised him.So ’ hypocritical It ’ simply adjusting Washington D.C. live Washington D.C. Democrat votes support spending bill Because every spending bill takes 60 votes.Does answer question Q So Democratic administration — let ’ say one 4 years 8 years 12 years whatever.DIRECTOR MULVANEY Right.Q Will deficit hawk DIRECTOR MULVANEY I always deficit hawk I today I yesterday tomorrow I think spending bunch money ’ wrong I ’ telling cards ’ dealt administration This would prefer spend money ’ going get spent We ’ think spend it.Yes ’ am.Q Can I follow quickly And I another one Because underlying budget without taking account caps agreement —DIRECTOR MULVANEY Yes.Q — also ’ balance 10 years right You never eliminate deficits 10-year window So President resigned fact work Congress budget never balanced DIRECTOR MULVANEY Well keep mind — well goes back I talked end — budget last year — I think I said ’ start moving needle really really quickly window going close able balance within 10 years And ’ start moving —Q So window already closed DIRECTOR MULVANEY Yeah Yes I think I said last year I expected last year ’ budget — I think I stood podium said “ I think probably last budget balance within 10-year window unless ’ dramatic changes. ” And ’ dramatic changes.We knew last year ’ facing ’ — ’ reality situation.Yes ’ am.Q Quick follow-up entitlement cuts.DIRECTOR MULVANEY Yeah.Q You talked Medicare There ’ also I believe — I think trillion Medicaid spending cuts moving money around goes Medicaid grant programs discretionary.DIRECTOR MULVANEY Yeah.Q Can talk entitlements affected 1.7 trillion DIRECTOR MULVANEY Well I ’ — ’ 1.7 trillion coming Q That ’ overall cuts ’ looking mandatory spending.DIRECTOR MULVANEY Oh oh I ’ sorry Yeah okay Thanks much And I ’ know allocation ’ part Medicaid Because keep mind talk mandatory spending people think ’ Medicare Medicaid Social Security ’ actually lot So ’ fair say okay 1.7 trillion mandatory savings ’ got 236 billion Medicare rest comes Medicaid That ’ accurate.So I ’ know number Medicaid But I tell Medicaid biggest assumptions made — proposals make — go ahead pass Graham-Cassidy — Obamacare repeal replace bill transitions Medicaid block-grant system states Under proposal block grants states would actually go every single year Every single year Or every single year except one Every single year Grogan Our block grants states one year sort dip STAFF MEMBER Every year.Q At rate DIRECTOR MULVANEY I ’ remember — oh rate slower — ’ change So assume Graham-Cassidy Medicaid grow CPI — CPI medical CPI —STAFF MEMBER CPI-U.DIRECTOR MULVANEY — CPI-U instead CPI medical data historical actual growth rates Medicaid costs CPI-U CPI Medicaid.So ’ saying think program growing faster needs order provide level services So two biggest changes Medicaid.Yes ’ am.Q Yes I want go really fast Pell Grant SNAP I want get weeds SNAP issue said Blue Apron Is effort help —DIRECTOR MULVANEY And call food box Blue Apron private business I want make clear We hiring Blue Apron It ’ food box program people know Blue Apron is.Q And I want get weeds What going box Is going like fresh vegetables Because I mean follow example boxed food commercial programs ’ issues I guess And utilizing U.S Postal Service Is effort help bolster Postal Service well DIRECTOR MULVANEY Yeah I ’ know Postal Service question.STAFF MEMBER It ’ — states able —DIRECTOR MULVANEY Okay goes individual state.As actual food box program I think ’ using current program seniors model ’ getting rid — way budget see ’ getting rid current food box program seniors Been long time right And ’ ’ going feed seniors food All ’ folding folks food box program So ’ going food stamp — SNAP program food box seniors ’ putting everybody together one program So see please get clarifications.But I ’ told USDA ’ 100 percent domestically grown food And pitched nutritious may otherwise be.Last question Yeah follow-up Yes ’ am.Q Yeah Pell Grants What plus number Why plus number That one first things first one — first chart.DIRECTOR MULVANEY I ’ remember plus-up Pell Grant I know big substantive change expanded Pell Grant go short-term program used vocational training stuff Is STAFF MEMBER The number rescission taken We inaudible Pell short-term programs.DIRECTOR MULVANEY Okay So ’ expanding — number saw screen rescission That ’ one smoke mirrors things okay But expansion program — yeah rescissions CHIMPs carry-forward balances I ’ learned lot I ever care think about.But expansion Pell program short-term program So would qualify folks vocational training lot times ’ qualify Pell.Q So ’ summer winter — ’ all-year round vocations schools.DIRECTOR MULVANEY Yeah well I think year last.Q Yeah ’ year ’ adding vocational.DIRECTOR MULVANEY We year-round last year ’ adding short-term.Last question.Q Thank The defense budget.DIRECTOR MULVANEY Yeah.Q This morning President said ’ going far ahead everyone else nuclear How much budget addresses statement today addressing nuclear arsenal increase And specific numbers much ’ going increase many weapons translates STAFF MEMBER Within NSA ’ 11 billion budget That include platforms another 24 billion — 35 billion We ’ get exact numbers.Q Thanks And follow question ’ impetus What ’ philosophy behind Does administration believe win nuclear war DIRECTOR MULVANEY No I think President clear expects best weapons available And nuclear arsenal updated long time wants It priority last year ’ budget This news This —Q I ’ trying — I ’ trying understand Please help Because — I mean Carl Sagan said nuclear deterrent policy like two kids sitting room full gasoline arguing many matches I mean blow world plenty Why ’ leading world —DIRECTOR MULVANEY Well I think heard President say today ’ love But folks them.Q But ’ leading way.DIRECTORY MULVANEY Okay I going take questions honestly I
