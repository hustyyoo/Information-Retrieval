D.C. metropolitan area.And I ’ sure many know MS-13 probably violent ruthless gang terrorizing streets today Their motto “ Mata Viola Controla ” means “ Kill Rape Control. ” It motto indiscriminate violence MS-13 lives rules They commit rape robbery extortion murder often sake They attack victims chains bats machetes firearms MS-13 recruits children murderers They gang-rape young girls sell sex.I briefed President examples MS-13 ’ brutality These include 15-year-old Gaithersburg Maryland girl named Damaris Reyes Rivas stabbed 13 times knives wooden stake The girl ’ killers filmed murder could show gang leaders back El Salvador done Damaris ’ body savagely dumped next railroad tracks road Beltway many us take work every day.I briefed President MS-13 members murdered fellow gang member believed snitch murdered recruit violating gang rules One individuals head severed MS-13 buried two victims shallow graves park Falls Church Virginia — park 10 miles here.I briefed President Long Island victim lured woods Central Islip New York MS-13 members beat sticks fire extinguisher That gang members ultimately cut throat pocketknife sadistically stuffed body drainage pipe went undiscovered months.The Department Justice leadership Attorney General Sessions devoting resources accomplishing President ’ directive reducing violent crime ensuring citizens longer held hostage murderous savages like MS-13 members.Attorney General Sessions designated MS-13 priority Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces The Department Justice surging hundreds federal prosecutors new federal prosecutors field specifically focus violent crime immigration offenses.The Department enhanced relationships Northern Triangle countries — El Salvador Guatemala Honduras — target MS-13 This past summer Attorney General Sessions visited El Salvador met El Salvadorian Attorney General Douglas Melendez discuss joint efforts dismantle MS-13 roots.Soon meeting 70 700 gang members charged El Salvador And total work Central American partners thus far resulted arrest charges 4,000 suspected MS-13 members.The Justice Department coordination partners state local level continue prosecute scores MS-13 gang members located United States.But MS-13 based operates El Salvador MS-13 largely directs murderous mission prisons El Salvador must enforce domestic violent crime laws gang members United States.Our investigations revealed fail enforce immigration human smuggling laws fail enforce immigration laws allow loopholes exist let future MS-13 gang members country MS-13 easily simply replenish jailed membership sending gang members across borders.And reason well Department Justice also remains committed enforcing criminal immigration laws identifying targeting MS-13 ’ smuggling networks.To clear undertake lawful measures end scourge communities Thank attention Q I question yeah Given threat ’ discussing Attorney General Sessions renewed sort increase enforcement marijuana even though lot states tried decriminalize make legal MR CRONAN I ’ able talk much detail marijuana policy I say number policies Department Justice pursuing given day As Assistant Attorney General Criminal Division I ’ certainly seen harm marijuana But importantly priorities expense resources addressed marijuana policy.And respect MS-13 Attorney General made clear devoting sufficient resources additional resources ensure districts — U.S. attorneys ’ offices — prosecutors necessary address scourge communities.Q But finite resources correct So put priority area deprioritized considered nearly threat kind violence ’ talking MR CRONAN Well ’ dealing multiple priorities day Department Justice As matter allocating resources sufficient resources targeting MS-13 continue devote resources threat.Yes.Q John people community reading MS-13 since 2006 Is position previous two administrations Bush Obama simply prioritize Or much worse therefore justified focus ’ describing today MR CRONAN Yeah MS-13 ’ correct certainly around time I think ’ seen significant uptick violence past several years ’ looking acts atrocities ’ committed local communities really across country I think ’ new threat unlike one ’ really seen violent transnational organized crime operating United States soil.MS-13 like I said remarks 10,000 members United States across country 40 states District We MS-13 prosecutions going Virginia New York LA Texas around country And —Q Did previous two administrations appreciate let grow let become bigger problem MR CRONAN Well I ’ talk priorities previous administrations I talk priorities And combatting targeting MS-13 top priority administration Department Justice.But order effectively target MS-13 ’ enough federal state authorities enforcing criminal laws respect MS-13 members U.S. soil We also make sure MS-13 position replenish ranks sending additional members additional unaccompanied children United States later recruited MS-13 murderers years road.Unless ’ able ’ constant situation MS-13 reconstituting ranks without us able effectively eradicate U.S. society.Q Two questions Last year President Trump talked MS-13 We saw graphic detail MS-13 Now ’ given President update What beyond immigration issue Justice Department break back MS-13 That ’ first question.MR CRONAN Sure Well first question Department Justice continue dedicate considerable resources ensure MS-13 targeted.And I think ’ seeing ’ working Last year Department Justice secured convictions — secured convictions 1,200 gang members We charged federal firearms offenses decade We brought cases violent criminals least quarter century So domestically ’ ’ going continue that.I mentioned additional prosecutors going sent field There additional prosecutors going specific areas MS-13 problem enforce robust criminal statutes allow us target variety conduct — robbery racketeering murder drug trafficking — get streets.Another important component capacity-building One focus I mention working partners Northern Triangle countries Central America We provide training law enforcement prosecutors whatever systems make sure able target MS-13 — roots El Salvador Honduras Guatemala threat hits United States soil.So ’ multi-tiered attack Department Justice undertaking.Q And second question — yeah second question another issue And I ’ glad ’ today The Eric Garner case — ’ still people waiting indictment His mother looking justice He cried 11 times “ I ’ breathe. ” What ’ new What ’ happening What expect case MR CRONAN With respect case I updates I would able share I think would better directed inaudible U.S. Attorney ’ Office.Q But ’ criminal — understand criminal department — criminal portion Justice So I mean movement Because I ’ hearing indictment here.MR CRONAN And I apologize extent ongoing investigation exists I ’ able talk beyond point I apologize.Yeah please.Q Jonathan Cabinet Room gave first presentation whole MS-13 issue wrapped need increase border enforcement change immigration laws Do idea many 10,000 gang members MS-13 country legally many illegally MR CRONAN It ’ hard put statistic number often caught enter country without us knowing But I would give one example kind snapshot seeing.This past November Department Justice Department Homeland Security announced results Operation Raging Bull Operation Raging Bull enhanced efforts target MS-13 culminated arrest 200 — 267 arrests United States El Salvador.In United States 214 arrests Ninety-four criminal charges federal state murder racketeering robbery firearms many offenses Of 214 individuals arrested United States 198 foreign nationals 5 — 5 198 legal status United States And 64 illegally crossed border unaccompanied children many since become adults.So I number give statistic give But I think snapshot Operation Raging Bull gives sense extent problems.Yes.Q Isn ’ true MS-13 makes small fraction gang members country though MR CRONAN I ’ know percentage gang members makes Department Justice efforts obviously targeting violent gangs limited MS-13 We numerous prosecutions going around country violent subsets Bloods group called Nine Trey Gangsters Not long ago announced charges Mongols Motorcycle gang.There many gang prosecutions going around country say MS-13 threat face That ’ certainly case But MS-13 unique threat It violence sake violence It indiscriminate killing It brutality terrorizing communities And ’ also threat tough stop ’ position MS-13 able replenish ranks incarcerate members United States.Q Few people would certainly argue characterization MS-13 targets communities country But would say critics say ’ using gang basically paint broad brushstroke immigrants scare people MR CRONAN I think look reality actions MS-13 D.C. metropolitan area Long Island around country scare tactics used Department Justice ’ MS-13 It brutal gang savages engaging indiscriminate violence communities.Q You talked Attorney General ’ leadership Jeff Sessions ’ ’ fighting gang problem And I want ask somebody else ’ leader DOJ Rod Rosenstein Are comfortable leadership Do believe rank-and-file comfortable Do believe ’ unfairly maligned President MR CRONAN You know I — I ’ talk MS-13 asked stay topic But I say Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein former U.S. attorney Maryland someone saw firsthand devastating effects MS-13 district He someone intricate understanding threat shares Attorney General ’ commitment targeting threat ’ supportive efforts targeting MS-13.Q So question — really quick May — look local law enforcement — one biggest problems local law enforcement believe particular rules ’ actually causing problems people immigrant communities afraid come forward testify MS-13 believe ’ going deported so.Can least give assurance immigrant communities particularly Gaithersburg Maryland — brought one people — police Montgomery County difficult time getting people come forward witnesses afraid would deported so.So rules — ’ scaring people away Can address MR CRONAN Well I think local law enforcement largely supportive Department ’ efforts target MS-13 To extent individuals scared testify MS-13 members I think need look MS-13 targeting people perceived snitches putting shallow graves It ’ actions Department Justice.Q No well ’ afraid ’ going ship deport That ’ real fear They ’ expressed fear.MR CRONAN And opportunities immigration relief If someone real fear providing testimony could pursue relief well appropriate circumstances.Q You see might problem though prosecuting case MR CRONAN We always deal situations cooperating witnesses deal fears cooperating witnesses address fears appropriate.MS SANDERS Thank John On lighter subjects cover I ’ take questions.As probably saw

achieve anything hard work determination perseverance And sometimes need take chance put there.That ’ exactly letter ’ excited meet person soon.And I take questions.Q Sarah President ’ shutdown comments minutes ago weeks ago said shutdown would devastating military Does feel shutdown would worth even members U.S. military negatively impacted MS SANDERS Look people caused shutdown Democrats repeatedly held government hostage politics.Democrats actually shut government — let ’ forget — couple weeks ago The President ’ looking But Democrat Party going continue threaten shutdown ’ include responsible immigration reforms including fixing MS-13 loopholes issues President welcomes fight It ’ fight last time ’ one ’ confident would win again.But let repeat goal get two-year budget deal also get deal immigration laid The President generously laid plan addresses Republicans ’ Democrats ’ concerns ’ hopeful ’ come agreement fronts.Q But ’ President encouraging shutdown MS SANDERS The President encouraging people jobs The President encouraging get deal budget ’ laid two-year long-term budget deal actually helps military instead short-term deals That ’ ’ advocated along President encouraging jobs come agreement immigration particularly four places ’ outlined happen piece legislation.Q Can clarify would President rather see shutdown short-term spending fix week MS SANDERS Look advocating shutdown That ’ fault Democrats willing jobs.The President wants long-term deal wants get deal immigration And hope Democrats come table get things done.Q And I ’ hoping clarify one thing Chief Staff John Kelly said today DREAMers “ Too lazy get asses ” register DACA protections Is position White House DREAMers lazy Who thinks MS SANDERS The positon White House want fix problem created previous administration We system lawful We system lot legal loopholes large national security concern We want address completely We want solve problem DACA want solve border security issue We want end chain migration We want end visa lottery system.What ’ want continue kicking road We ’ focused actually getting solution And frankly I think anybody lazy ’ probably Democrats ’ showing work ’ actually getting table make deal this.Q Sarah President make stock market ’ volatility yesterday today And regrets taking responsibility credit stock market ’ rise MS SANDERS Look economy incredibly strong right The President ’ focus continues long-term economic fundamentals like I said strong country.We ’ infinitely better today President took office particularly economy We historically low unemployment actually increasing wages American workers There ’ nothing ’ taken place last couple days economy ’ fundamentally different two weeks ago ’ comfortable right now.Q Does second thoughts

determination time.Q Before review concluded last time President made clear lawmakers inclined release Republican memo Has made kind similar comments guys Democratic memo MS SANDERS The President made comment ’ going go process went first time And take several days complete first time ’ make determination point.Jon.Q Thanks lot Sarah The President Republican memo says completely vindicates And weekend heard Trey Gowdy Intelligence Committee large part writing memo In way President believe Republican memo vindicates MS SANDERS Look President consistently called Russia investigation “ politically motivated ” “ witch hunt ” last year And memo clearly vindicates President ’ positon political bias process It ’ pretty simple.Major.Q Sarah I would think ’ fair say many members Senate including Mitch McConnell Chuck Schumer surprised President ’ comments So I ’ like see I could figure exactly driving Is President saying unless immigration compromise ’ satisfied sign emerging budget compromise two-year budget deal McConnell Schumer working Or deal separately budget talks going And represent — making substantial progress.MS SANDERS As I ’ said want two-year budget deal We ’ see looks like We certainly —Q Does immigration included MS SANDERS — supportive Republicans Democrats coming deal We also want deal immigration.Q But together MS SANDERS They ’ mutually exclusive The President wants get deal inaudible .Q Will sign budget deal include immigration policy reforms MS SANDERS I ’ think expect budget deal include specifics immigration reform want get deal As ’ said ’ want hold government hostage items.Q So let ask one thing — Senator Flake said something Senate floor minute ago I want give chance respond He said I quote —MS SANDERS I ’ sure eventful.Q — “ I seen President ’ ardent defenders use weary argument President ’ comments meant joke sarcasm tongue-in-cheek But treason punchline. ” Can say sake future agree Senator Flake treason treasonous punchline joking matter MS SANDERS Look honestly I ’ going respond directly Senator Flake ’ comments I ’ really care Senator Flake say I ’ think constituents either I think ’ numbers tank.The President clearly joking comments But ’ joke Democrats refuse celebrate accomplishments last year helped Americans.What I ’ understand I ’ think country understands Democrats upset lower taxes higher wages That ’ something every American celebrating crying sitting hands Democrats going make decision point really soon Do hate President love country And I hope answer “ No. ” Q Sarah I want ask question —Q Sarah thank Sarah call me.MS SANDERS I ’ come back Sorry Steven.Q Thanks Sarah I want ask question stocks On positive economic news school thought among economists given current growth economy inject economy stimulus tax cuts could actually spark inflation So — means people money spend prices necessarily go prices people pay go And ’ good thing.So keenly focused President inflation fears And ahead next month ’ Fed meeting President spoken Chairman Powell whether thinks interest rates go MS SANDERS Look team close contact stakeholders process I said President ’ focus long-term economic fundamentals And ’ going continue focused aspects —Q Any thought interest rates one way MS SANDERS Nothing specific announce time.Kristen.Q Sarah related Republican memo President White House argued important release sake transparency So therefore American people expect see Democratic memo sake transparency MS SANDERS I think American people expect memo go exact process Republican memo went involves bringing stakeholders legal national security perspective weigh making determination We ’ middle process I ’ going get —Q Inaudible determination prior releasing Republican memo So relates transparency —MS SANDERS We ’ even release memo prior review process complete.Q He said “ 100 percent. ” He said “ 100 percent ” —MS SANDERS We ’ release memo prior review process complete ’ going time.Q One question John Kelly comments calling DREAMers — indicating lazy Does type rhetoric help get bipartisan deal done MS SANDERS Look like I said President administration — ’ focused actually solving problem kicking road And ’ going continue conversations.John.Q Sarah also Capitol Hill today Chief Staff Kelly said ’ think President would likely extend DACA deadline March 5th But twice Davos President said “ If need little time ’ take little time ” DACA And gaggle asked would extend deadline said “ Yeah I might I might that…not guaranteeing it…but I certainly right I want ” So Is still open idea extending deadline closed MS SANDERS He certainly right Again ’ hopeful ’ going get deal We ’ laid generous offer meets demands Democrats In fact goes beyond asked includes mostly — everything else part pillars laid things Democrats voted for.Elizabeth Warren Chuck Schumer individuals voted majority priorities ’ laid legislation past except ’ actually gone DACA component Obama ever offered And fact ’ get deal ’ question frankly Democrats asked like supportive legislation And moving ball forward actually solving problem Q Sarah clarify open extending deadline door closed MS

North Korean officials Or MS SANDERS I ’ announcements ’ see I ’ going echo Vice President Secretary State I ’ certainly going get ahead either them.Q Will administration rule Vice President speak North Koreans ’ MS SANDERS I think answer remains We ’ see.Jim.Q Can I get back Chief Staff saying DREAMers may lazy get asses Just face ’ wildly offensive comment undocumented immigrants waiting kind solution come city MS SANDERS Look person ’ actually offered solution administration The President champion giving 1.8 million DACA recipients DACA-eligible people pathway citizenship And ’ laid plan solution actually addresses Republicans ’ Democrats ’ concerns I think ’ hard argue that.Q On surface Sarah though ’ — ’ offensive comment though ’ Just surface.MS SANDERS I think ’ something would decide yourself.David.Q Sarah President ’ lawyers advised testify Robert Mueller MS SANDERS Look ’ said many times something would determined Office Special Counsel I ’ refer statement Ty Cobb “ The
