Remarks President Trump Vice President Pence Members Congress Members Cabinet Meeting Trade Remarks Infrastructure Technology Issued February 13 2018 Cabinet Room 11:44 A.M. ESTTHE PRESIDENT Okay thank much I ’ delighted welcome Republicans Democrats Nice sound Isn ’ nice sound And ’ discussing DACA ’ plenty discussion right going DACA House Senate White House.We ’ today discuss matter vital importance nation ’ economy security I ’ discussing years And I ’ certainly discussed great detail campaign trail That ’ America ’ aluminum steel industries many industries taken advantage countries And I alluded yesterday too.Last year I directed Secretary Commerce investigate whether steel aluminum imports threatening impair U.S. national security You see ’ happened steel aluminum industries They ’ decimated dumping many countries particular one many countries They ’ dumping destroying industry destroying families workers And ’ let happen.Secretary Ross submitted result investigations last month My administration reviewing reports considering options And part options would tariffs coming As dump steel pay tariffs — substantial tariffs — means United States would actually make lot money probably steel industry aluminum industry would come back country Right ’ decimated.It ’ make decision I make decision reflects best interests United States including need address overproduction China countries You countries overproducing ’ dumping us And look empty factories steel factories plants ’ sad thing look at.I ’ watching — I ’ looking two years I went around campaigning No matter go look see happened U.S. Steel companies They giants ’ hanging life.I look forward hearing views I ’ like speak And strong — I know Roy probably pretty strong views this.I look two ways I want keep prices I also want make sure steel industry aluminum industry need national defense If ever conflict ’ want buying steel country ’ fighting somehow ’ work well.But hopefully ’ conflicts still consider And look national defense look steel industry We without steel industry We without aluminum industry And ’ talking tariffs and/or quotas.I think maybe Roy would like start We ’ discussed past Do suggestion SENATOR BLUNT Well Mr. President I think need careful ’ start reciprocal battle tariffs You know make aluminum make steel Missouri buy lot aluminum buy lot steel well —THE PRESIDENT That ’ right.SENATOR BLUNT — bass boats beer cans There ’ lot aluminum We ’ got aluminum manufacturer closed special electric rates reopening new management.And clearly ’ concerned new jobs also concerned jobs — whether ’ electric steel area aluminum area price sensitive here.THE PRESIDENT Good And I understand well One thing I — I want tell got notice General Motors Korea announces first step necessary restructuring They ’ going — GM Korea company announced today cease production close Gunsan plant May 2018 ’ going move back Detroit.You ’ hear things except fact Trump became President Believe ’ hearing So ’ moving back Korea Detroit They ’ moving.Also saw Chrysler moving Mexico Michigan And many companies They want action The big tax cuts big impact And Kevin knows maybe better anybody But big impact decision.But see General Motors — bad trade deal Korea Very bad trade deal It ’ deal — ’ incompetent somebody could made deal like that.So horrible trade deal Korea But even something — ’ negotiating trade deal Korea ’ either negotiate fair deal ’ going terminate deal But already General Motors coming back Detroit That really significant statement Many others follow many countries.Mike go ahead.REPRESENTATIVE BOST Mr. President let tell 2,800 people laid district 2015 steel plant ’ operating 100 years The concern steel plant produces ’ known oil country tubular goods — OCTG.OCTG ’ expiration everything like oil — Korea dumped 200 percent last year overabundance particular market Because ’ able get 2,800 jobs back And like I said That group people —THE PRESIDENT So go It went Korea REPRESENTATIVE BOST All products — ’ even coming Korea ’ turned And unless use power 232 — something goes south sudden ’ trying become energy independent — plants ’ turn overnight ’ got try something work long-term goal that.THE PRESIDENT The Korean Agreement — know Mike people table — done last administration It supposed produce 150,000 200,000 jobs And — Korea For us produced nothing losses It ’ horrible deal All look You know ’ going bad.So Korea deal disaster It supposed good us turned bad us And — know ’ one example many examples country So I think General Motors moving back Detroit fantastic thing That ’ sign many companies come.Mike Pence would something say THE VICE PRESIDENT Well thank Mr. President I want thank Republican Democrats taking time profound interest issue.To point economy ’ national security And President directed 232 review determine whether national security affected dumping steel aluminum.And today much President ’ desire administration ’ desire hear perspectives also inform decisions President make.I think ’ fair say support national security I think ’ evidenced recent budget agreement President helped drive Republicans Democrats supported historic increase national defense.But also support American jobs And much look forward counsel President approaches decision I appreciate bipartisan spirit meeting conversation follow.THE PRESIDENT And really Mike said I want hear sides We lot great representatives Democrats Republicans I want hear sides make decision.In one case ’ going create jobs You may higher price maybe little bit higher ’ going jobs In case may lower price ’ going jobs ’ going made China places So big decisions But jobs important.Todd something say SENATOR YOUNG Mr. President thank us today I represent state major manufacturer steel — U.S. Steel ArcelorMittal others manufacturing — downstream users alluded So clearly understand need balance two come balanced approach here.I think main target — I ’ speak plainly sir — China They ’ violating international rules stealing intellectual property overproducing steel products products And —THE PRESIDENT We ’ spoken strongly We ’ told We something coming near future know But told ’ continue.We trade deficit China — I inherited way — trade deficit 504 billion okay So think look well many bridges ’ building many jets ’ building fighter planes — We People sat seat allowed this.So ’ going allow We ’ talking right strongly And hopefully ’ great relationship ’ talking strongly Todd You ’ right — ’ big percentage deficits And money ’ lost jobs ’ lost China ’ unthinkable people allowed happen.And period — Obama This period many years happened.So thank much Todd.Pat would like say something SENATOR TOOMEY Sure Thanks much Mr. President I would urge us go cautiously especially section 232.As know defense needs consume 3 percent domestic steel consumption So I think ’ implausible believe ’ able meet needs defense industry absolutely essential.Imports 2016 16 percent domestic consumption So vast majority steel consume fact produce — way I prefer case today China 2 percent 16 percent small portion.My main message —THE PRESIDENT But transshipping.SENATOR TOOMEY Absolutely So —THE PRESIDENT They would ship countries steel would come countries ’ see steel coming from.SENATOR TOOMEY Right So I would urge country violating trade laws trade agreements go Countervailing duty dumping ’ happening.THE PRESIDENT That ’ countries That ’ countries.SENATOR TOOMEY But 232 different matter invoking national security I think ’ really hard make case invites retaliation problematic us.THE PRESIDENT Well word “ retaliation ” Pat interesting And I know agree We many countries made product make product pay tremendous — pay tremendous tax get countries — motorcycles Harley Davidson — goes certain country I ’ mention fact happens India case Laughter And great gentleman called India said reduced tariff motorcycles reduced 50 percent — 5-0 — 75 even 100 percent And — Harley Davidson 50 75 percent tax tariff get motorcycle product And yet sell thousands thousands motorcycles lot people ’ know India United States You know tax Nothing.So I say reciprocal taxes case like I ’ blaming India I think ’ great get away I ’ know people allowed get away But ’ example ’ unfair And I think reciprocal tax.That ’ called fair trade It ’ called free trade Because ultimately ’ going happen — either ’ collect ’ collecting probably happens ’ end charging tax ’ tax And becomes free trade.So many examples like And word “ reciprocal ” Pat said — I mean world “ reciprocal ” important word We countries taking advantage us They ’ charging us massive tariffs us sell product countries And sell us zero We charge zero We ’ like stupid people I ’ like anymore.So ’ going change ’ going make fair And I call fair trade And one two things happen But I think ’ going happen ’ reduce tax tax.Mike would like say something SENATOR LEE Yeah sure One things worries regard proposed action ’ many things manufactured United States ’ many jobs attached many things manufactured United States use steel aluminum inputs.Now case steel ’ talking 16 percent ’ imported But availability imports absence additional duties means goods manufactured sold cost effectively That keeps whole lot people including whole lot voters states — whole lot mine certainly — jobs.And even though may job winners action like I strongly suspect times case past would end net job losses United States And ’ worries particularly light absence I see real national security threat Only 3 percent ’ able produce domestically ’ needed national security reasons I think ought taken account.THE PRESIDENT No number going way big military spending You know — something agree We lot work military Our military taken care properly ’ taken care properly So 3 percent number going way But time ’ tremendous — know ’ — percentage ’ tremendous number.I say Steel aluminum interesting It create lot jobs I believe dumpers eat lot tax keep people working And reasons.But I say finished product much simpler thing As example Germany sends us cars We send cars practically ’ take I mean many Chevrolets see middle Berlin Not many folks Laughter Not many But send Mercedes send BMW They send tremendous numbers.Japan sends us tremendous numbers cars They also make cars In way ’ tax All Mike simple — factory There ’ tax Now sudden ’ tax So ’ build factories order avoid tax.But cars television sets things like ’ dumping us — ’ make television sets anymore country They come South Korea come lesser extent Japan Most come South Korea It ’ fair And I believe reciprocal taxes likewise.That ’ different product ’ much simpler — know washing machines saw couple weeks ago It ’ huge impact industry A huge impact And way know ’ happening The people made washing machines outside country expanding factories United States ’ pay 25 30 percent tax.And thing happening solar panels We ’ starting make — 32 companies I think ’ Gary two right We made solar panels every one companies wiped And I say agreed — made much higher quality much better solar panel We make better ’ compete Now — ’ lot good — lot places opening They ’ starting make solar panels again.So finished product ’ little bit different But steel aluminum ’ talking today — know ’ good point Mike You ’ right The question would rather pay little bit create jobs country And ’ possible ’ creating — really ’ much problem terms pricing Because I actually think lot countries going eat want continue know export And ’ making fortune.Look rebuilt China We rebuilt lot — money ’ taken United States We ’ like piggybank people running ’ know hell And rebuilt countries like massively You look countries — look South Korea look Japan look many countries And defend top everything else.So defend Saudi Arabia They pay us fraction costs We defend Japan We defend South Korea They pay us fraction costs And ’ talking countries ’ fair defend pay us fraction cost defense Separate argument real problem.Gary would like say something MR COHN Senator Wyden would like —THE PRESIDENT Senator go ahead.SENATOR WYDEN Thank Mr. President We Senator Brown Senator Peters Senator Casey So ’ got good collection Finance Committee Commerce Committee.I ’ make two points really quickly Mr. President First yesterday released infrastructure plan And I looked carefully I ’ see even incentives let alone requirements use American steel Now Senator Brown I think always says great opportunity bipartisanship If work one ought no-brainer.THE PRESIDENT We It ’ easy one.SENATOR WYDEN And ’ one thing point Mr. President I ’ brief And actually respect American steel way plan reads actually allows states walk back commitments use American steel So point one would could work Point two Secretary Ambassador Lighthizer forthcoming working us But trying see 232 report And appreciate asking us advice We need see report order give specifics But I come back Senator Brown ’ point I think ’ opportunity real bipartisanship would two areas.THE PRESIDENT I agree And I ’ like come back suggestion infrastructure plan And I think ’ bipartisan plan.I tell I approved two pipelines — Keystone — know two big ones And I approved I said “ Where ’ steel made ” And told location make happy And I wrote steel made pipelines — know ’ got made United States And ’ got fabricated United States And I ’ believer also.But would come back suggestion would great.Bob 232 AMBASSADOR LIGHTHIZER Well I think could put report But rather focus let say I want sort second Senator says Trade always bipartisan country last years And I really think NAFTA things ’ Democrats Republicans vote large number together start new way approach this.That really point I wanted make I think Senator Wyden I think Senator Brown feels exactly —PARTICIPANT And Senator Casey.PARTICIPANT Can I speak THE PRESIDENT Go ahead.SENATOR BROWN Thank I much appreciate work Ambassador Lighthizer done generally specifically 232 And Secretary Ross worked 232 And I want talk moment NAFTA Not much Ambassador Lighthizer good that.I mean trade says always nonpartisan And I think good evidence Senator Portman colleague Cincinnati — I ’ Cleveland — ’ able together Level Playing Field Act trade remedy trade enforcement currency recently Clyde Ohio washing machine case And appreciate ’ done here.I sent President transition staff — three days election sent letter outlining together trade And President — thank — sent back nice handwritten note I appreciate working together everything TPP non-market economy status 232 washing machine case issues And I asked washing machine case ’ 3,000 jobs small town Northwest Ohio hour Toledo So really matters lot families.I ’ hopeful quick action 232 It needs comprehensive aimed Todd said certainly China But beyond China 232 needs apply broadly.And I also — I conclude work NAFTA together Well I work NAFTA written way supports workers I ’ confident Ambassador Lighthizer ’ handprints deliver Democratic support It bipartisan done right And ’ reputation ’ I ’ continue fight for.And I know Senator Wyden Senator Casey Senator Peters board that.THE PRESIDENT Good I actually think go bipartisan infrastructure maybe even DACA Because difference want help DACA ’ Okay Laughter I ’ kidding I ’ sure I hope can.By way ’ table I hope DACA That ’ currently Everybody working hard right I think chance DACA bipartisan I think happen I hope ’ going able Senator.SENATOR BROWN It ’ important inaudible .THE PRESIDENT And I think will.On infrastructure purpose ’ today come back proposal We put bid Come back proposal We lot people great Republicans want something happen We rebuild country.You know I said yesterday ’ spent 7 trillion When I say “ spent ” I mean wasted mention lives — importantly — everything else But ’ spent 7 trillion two months ago Middle East — 7 trillion And want borrow two dollars build road someplace including state great state Ohio — want build road want build tunnel bridge fix bridge many bad shape ’ And yet spent 7 trillion Middle East Explain one.SENATOR BROWN We ’ bipartisan — bipartisan proposal.THE PRESIDENT We fast.SENATOR BROWN With real dollars infrastructure We ’ glad inaudible —THE PRESIDENT We fast.SENATOR BROWN — work together real infrastructure bill real dollars plus leverage communities private sector.THE PRESIDENT Right Do combination.SENATOR BROWN It needs real dollars.THE PRESIDENT I would love get back us quickly quickly And rebuild country We rebuild roads bridges tunnels So faster get back faster move Focus DACA week ’ mind Right But faster get back faster move.Jackie going say REPRESENTATIVE WALORSKI Thank Mr. President I ’ grateful willingness sit listen talk today.But I represent recreational vehicle industry northern Indiana Elkhart County We 85 percent market And I ’ defense hawk I get ’ saying I get ’ saying around table We ’ one largest manufacturing districts country.And problem right even mere — look balance talk balance mere threat tariffs right folks manufacturing right — employee 15,000 people district Indiana And guy — one guys called morning said mere threat tariffs right already raised aluminum steel costs 25 percent Canadian softwood raised 20 percent The labor cost industry already 10 15 percent job market tight.And market 21 percent unemployment really financial crisis country ’ 2.1 percent Their concern concern seriously balanced effort able keep retain momentum place like northern Indiana fair time I 100 percent supportive do.I would ask look balance ’ current employees giant growth tax reform helped two months ago.THE PRESIDENT But ask manufacturers —REPRESENTATIVE WALORSKI Sure.THE PRESIDENT — I know manufacturers They great me.REPRESENTATIVE WALORSKI Absolutely yeah.THE PRESIDENT And ’ friends And voted And — ’ great people But ask one question When build product send big beautiful product make like nobody else send another country much tax country charge And therefore ’ sell much tax high.And one things want want fairness We ’ want ’ happening Because look well come compete take product nothing And want sell product overseas — probably triple market ever could get But lot manufacturers given They ’ given They ’ even talk.I tell Harley Davidson — I saying well ’ story They saying ’ 75 100 percent tax They got used many years For many years ’ even asking I mean I ’ others ’ even asking ’ gotten used And folks gotten used Because take great product sell overseas make almost impossible — monetarily tax also criteria make impossible.REPRESENTATIVE WALORSKI I understand But I would say Mr. President ’ also second issue developed country corporations producing quality vehicles true-American smelters left And reference costs ’ even fill products customers ’ got people standing line buy — right THE PRESIDENT Okay Let ’ —REPRESENTATIVE WALORSKI So ’ buy specs ’ job.THE PRESIDENT No I get We want combination big competition including competition within country competing And want take outside sources But want competition want jobs.REPRESENTATIVE WALORSKI We want customer service.THE PRESIDENT And want customer service That ’ right Any questions Yes Senator — Lamar.SENATOR ALEXANDER Mr. President thank much —THE PRESIDENT How ’ healthcare going SENATOR ALEXANDER Good Thanks.THE PRESIDENT Good That ’ I hear.SENATOR ALEXANDER Thank support sticking us I talked Senator Murray —THE PRESIDENT Good.SENATOR ALEXANDER — earlier ’ making progress.THE PRESIDENT Good.SENATOR ALEXANDER Thank much thanks Vice President work that.If I could use two 60-second stories — I ’ know exactly tariff proposed And I thank us ’ made decision ’ big help I thank that.So two examples I hope look carefully President George W. Bush 2002 imposed 30 percent steel tariffs — 30 percent increase — tariffs China South Korea couple places The effect one even though 5 percent imported steel raised price almost steel United States.Two time auto-parts manufacturers used steel began cut jobs move outside country could buy steel make part ship part back without tariff And found 10 times many people steel-using industries steel-producing industries And according auto manufacturers lost jobs exist steel industry.So ’ — questions would raise prices —THE PRESIDENT Lamar ’ work Bush nothing worked Bush Laughter SENATOR ALEXANDER Well I ’ t–THE PRESIDENT It ’ work Bush worked others It work others But ’ right work Bush.SENATOR ALEXANDER Well ’ — I ’ recommending solution I ’ saying ’ worth looking happened backfired raised prices lost jobs.And 60-second story dad worked Alcoa smelting plant Tennessee We ’ smelting plants aluminum anymore use lot electricity make ’ never coming back really I think six left.So ’ lucky enough making auto parts aluminum cars Jobs coming back But put tariff ingots come overseas raise prices hurt Our aluminum comes Canada None China So I hope ’ look carefully aluminum comes from.THE PRESIDENT Okay.SENATOR ALEXANDER So thank much —THE PRESIDENT And ’ right Now I say Canada treated us unfairly comes lumber timber Very unfairly So understand You know ’ one thing another Canada tough country comes timber lumber things.And easy comes Wisconsin farmers Because try ship product Canada ’ farmer — farmer Wisconsin places — try ship things Canada ’ tough — ’ tough situation I say that.But I agree ’ saying It ’ much double-edged sword.Ron.SENATOR JOHNSON Well mentioned Wisconsin —THE PRESIDENT Good.SENATOR JOHNSON — understand I obviously manufacturing 30-some years And I ’ exported lot products though The fact matter Mr. President Wisconsin operates trade surplus Canada Mexico export manufacturing products also agricultural products And trade works well Wisconsin.I agree concerns pressed well concerns Senator Toomey Senator Lee What basic root cause problem massive overcapacity — primarily China ’ true How address And I think need cautious without raising increase — without raising prices.Senator Alexander talking 2002 Spot prices increased somewhere 69 82 percent Producer prices went 19 27 percent.Now let add another dimension nobody really talked We ’ talked jobs absolutely want highest paying jobs I think tax reform going juice economy And tight labor market I think wages already increasing.In Wisconsin big manufacturing state seven years I visited one manufacturer could hire enough people That certainly experience last 20 25 years For host reasons tell kids get four-year degree We pay people work So need concerned tight labor market enough workers manufacturing.So final point makes sense try bring back high labor-content manufacturing America We need value added things And I would say proceed real caution Trade abuses — address attack Try figure address massive over-supply steel industry carefully experienced —THE PRESIDENT You ’ right Ron I agree.SENATOR JOHNSON Okay.THE PRESIDENT I agree 100 percent I say pool 100 million people — many want work want job A lot better working frankly laws And people ’ like talk But ’ competing government And great potential They sort want work ’ making less work stay home things.So address situation That ’ big problem.But pool 100 million people lot want work We also much merit-based immigration policy ’ going bring people going great workers ’ really fill Foxconn places Like I instrumental getting Foxconn know friendships great company And ’ going Wisconsin ’ going incredible They ’ going employ tremendous numbers people They ’ going build one biggest plants world So ’ going exciting.But people move big pool people want work can.Just address one point — trade deficit Canada We big imbalance least 17 billion And Mexico imbalance trade deficit 71 billion I believe number really much higher that.I might ask Bob Lighthizer discuss But going say one thing Ron SENATOR JOHNSON Sure Just long brought whole immigration debate absolutely doubt fix horribly broken legal immigration system One proposals literally three-year guest worker visa program managed states Let states determine industries — set wage rates completely control process.So I ’ hoping part bipartisan process actually fix horribly broken legal immigration system workers merit-based So I ask Democratic colleagues please work us let ’ fix DREAMer problem let ’ also fix horribly broken legal immigration system.THE PRESIDENT Good Thank Ron.Yes go ahead.SENATOR CASEY I want make point — back 232 I ’ focus steel 232 Pennsylvania In opening talked job impact well national security impact I ’ glad raised I ’ focus national security.In Western Pennsylvania well Eastern Pennsylvania two examples among several But two AK Steel Western Pennsylvania They last remaining manufacturer electrical steel meaning steel goes electricity grid They ’ hammered know.In eastern part state Senator Young Indiana mentioned ArcelorMittal —THE PRESIDENT They ’ hammered SENATOR CASEY Hammered remedy — 232 remedy.THE PRESIDENT Okay.SENATOR CASEY To extent focus I think steel executives — letter sent 1st February I think outlines problem But really national security issue.THE PRESIDENT Why ’ previous administration help steel workers Why ’ previous administration work 232 SENATOR CASEY Well look I think lot us disagreements years administration aggressive issue.THE PRESIDENT Tremendous disservice.SENATOR CASEY I hope — I know ’ 90-day period ’ I hope promptly determine it.THE PRESIDENT Good Thank much I appreciate it.Rob.SENATOR PORTMAN Mr. President I agree Bob ’ good example AK Steel last electrical steel manufacturer 101 percent increase last year electrical steel coming country It ’ small market ’ critical market They tell us ’ get relief ’ going pull business ’ steel goes transformers grid.And I think good example But I would say sir — ’ talked — response needs targeted electrical steel place target The place I think oil country product talked earlier This pipe tube Eighty-two percent increase And frankly coming Korea Korea ’ single rig In words ’ taking Chinese steel part ’ effect transshipping us.THE PRESIDENT They ’ lot transshipping.SENATOR PORTMAN And ’ hurting ability continue energy independence talked about.So two specific areas I think ’ opportunity something use 232 national security opposed 201 President Bush used.But let tell regard rolled steel regard products Senator Brown said ’ pretty good success going regard unfair trade practices And ’ Level Playing Field Act implemented And I told I think even stronger enforcement would great enable us —THE PRESIDENT Well little enforcement We ’ strongly enforcing And Wilbur might want talk But strongly — good enforcement previous this.SENATOR PORTMAN And second part — ’ right — regard Enforce Act And ’ — Ron Wyden Senator Brown I others worked But says country transships — words sends steel say Malaysia believe happens regard Chinese steel puts different stamp “ Made Malaysia ” sends — need aggressive going And ’ matter Customs Border Protection many responsibilities right now.But existing laws well And I think 232 part overall response needs targeted I agree Senator Alexander others said balance Senator Toomey others You got careful ’ want increase cost consumers steel products go manufacturing But areas like electrical like pipe tube ’ got stand help defend case electrical last American manufacturer.THE PRESIDENT Right Well know Rob steel coming country countries ’ even know steel They ’ make never made It ’ transshipping It ’ coming China others mostly China And send countries ’ make steel comes pouring country — free Free And ’ bad — bad situation.Kevin.REPRESENTATIVE BRADY Yeah one I think everyone room supports aggressively holding China accountable overcapacity major way Thank that.232 little like old-fashioned chemotherapy It ’ used much often much damage good And example — happens around country — send steel pellets Corpus Christi Austria company amazing job — super-refined specific job.We bring back Navasota Texas — district — refine even Sell many American energy companies use specialized steel compete win Russia China countries If transactions like pretty typical around country get caught case punished three American manufacturing industries way looking expanding tax reform plan.THE PRESIDENT That ’ right.REPRESENTATIVE BRADY And point — really targeted You really targeted Also ’ got allies us China ’ unfair trade practices We careful look decisions target make sure allies us this.THE PRESIDENT Okay Very good Thank Kevin.Go ahead Rick.REPRESENTATIVE CRAWFORD Thank Mr. President One thing I want point — conversation national security imperative I think ’ looked context defense industry.And I wanted add one thing It ’ ability address inputs — addressing needs defense industry ability produce consumption take infrastructure projects on.THE PRESIDENT Right That ’ right.REPRESENTATIVE CRAWFORD So I think ’ need focus percentages also broadly impacts ability provide inputs.And one thing I wanted mention 74 percent capacity right United States The steel industry losing market share translates —THE PRESIDENT Rapidly.REPRESENTATIVE CRAWFORD — economic loss communities Representative Bost — I co-chair steel caucus ’ keenly aware communities ’ kind certainty.THE PRESIDENT Good Thank Rick Thank much.Senator.SENATOR PETERS Hello Mr. President I appreciated comments Michigan auto industry I ’ like say big reason jobs coming back best workers anywhere world here.THE PRESIDENT Well ’ also true I agree.SENATOR PETERS That ’ ’ And build time build outstanding qualities long rules fair.So I appreciate issue And —THE PRESIDENT You great workers The problem ’ good policy ’ many jobs left But ’ coming back And like coming back Michigan.SENATOR PETERS Well ’ love coming back Michigan long fair rules —THE PRESIDENT Right.SENATOR PETERS — continue push forward.I would like pick Senator Alexander ’ comments also concerned auto parts industry well.THE PRESIDENT Right.SENATOR PETERS We probably jobs auto parts Michigan industrial sector go together.We ’ got deal steel pricing issue I agree everything ’ said But ’ dumping auto parts take away Michigan jobs well jobs around country.THE PRESIDENT You ’ right.SENATOR PETERS And I could bring one issue I think take look I ’ working bipartisan way Senator Burr issue related Commerce Department ability self-initiate trade enforcement actions smaller industries like steel aluminum washing machines — small businesses ’ resources quite frankly bring trade enforcement case —THE PRESIDENT Good point.SENATOR PETERS — go lawyers In Michigan example cherries Right ’ got dumping cherries ’ making difficult growers Michigan But ’ resources bring kinds enforcement actions.So ’ working legislation give Secretary Ross Department Commerce tools help small businesses.THE PRESIDENT I like that.SENATOR PETERS And I ’ love help.THE PRESIDENT You help I think ’ fantastic idea Because ’ right — ’ hire lawyers ’ small But ’ — know double way ’ big.Wilbur working SECRETARY ROSS Yes sir.THE PRESIDENT Good.SECRETARY ROSS As know first time many years Commerce Department initiate — self-initiate — happened — big industry It aluminum.But limitations conventional trade case main limitation ’ prevent people transshipment countries And lot 232 us solve problem.And 232 ’ mean tariff every single country It ’ mean tariff every single product It applied much surgical way And presented President range alternatives goes big tariff everything everywhere selective tariffs selective group countries.There one two countries figure quite prominently lists names come surprise But example —THE PRESIDENT And problem though transshipping.SECRETARY ROSS Yes.THE PRESIDENT You think ’ going put pinpoint country ship countries ’ even thinking about.SECRETARY ROSS Right And —THE PRESIDENT So careful that.SECRETARY ROSS Yeah So 232 would let us quotas countries ’ putting tariff Inaudible ’ shipping So ’ going restrict supply would prevent evildoers transshipping goods country.THE PRESIDENT Evildoers That ’ good word Of many Laughter SECRETARY ROSS Yes — Mr. President.THE PRESIDENT You ’ good job Wilbur Thank you.SECRETARY ROSS Thank Mr. President.THE PRESIDENT We ’ — ’ tough.Go ahead Fellas.REPRESENTATIVE JOHNSON Mr. President comments made — made today balance absolutely essential I mean managing job creation controlling cost time got major factors mix.Two points I ’ make.THE PRESIDENT And deficits Deficits REPRESENTATIVE JOHNSON Absolutely.THE PRESIDENT You know people ’ believe deficits They think ’ matter To I think matters lot.REPRESENTATIVE JOHNSON I think matters lot.Two points I ’ make One kind put stamp Senator Portman said AK Steel manufacturer America makes electrical steel necessary transformers feed produce electricity electric grid China — risk losing industry lose absolutely potentially hostage Chinese management maintenance electrical grid.Number two ’ made big case I think rightfully told world America open business And regulatory reforms ’ done tax reforms done put America back business.One biggest businesses promoting job creation today oil gas industry.THE PRESIDENT Right.REPRESENTATIVE JOHNSON And Eastern Southeastern Ohio big projects like ethane cracker plants require tremendous amount steel.We ’ got make sure whatever formula keeps cost projects huge I mean massive You ’ talking 6- 8-billion projects big cost increases steel could big deal.So got balance job creation cost.THE PRESIDENT I agree I agree And I know area well You ’ right.Yes.REPRESENTATIVE SMITH Thank Mr. President At home Southeast Missouri real example lost 900 jobs March 2016 aluminum smelter closed And I believe aluminum smelters reopened.I ’ fall underneath premise —THE PRESIDENT And different reason Because ’ done energy prices going low electric costs going low countries ’ going able compete us We ’ really great job bringing And lot tax cuts lots things too.REPRESENTATIVE SMITH Exactly.THE PRESIDENT Go ahead Tell that.REPRESENTATIVE SMITH When look Southeast Missouri median income household 40,000 It ’ one poorest congressional districts country And lost 900 jobs average salary 70,000 year hit home Bootheel Missouri.And without doubt look numbers aluminum production China 2000 10 percent world ’ production 2015 54 percent ’ problem Mr. President And I believe production back vacant facility New Madrid Missouri want open want create jobs.And I applaud looking 232 looking reasonable approach make sure ’ open business industries one.THE PRESIDENT Well remember tax tariff come build plants country So — ’ talking something nothing.Steel little bit different car It ’ little bit different washing machine things ’ talking But nevertheless build factory build plant United States tax So ’ big difference That ’ I think ’ going see General Motors — ’ coming back A lot companies coming back ’ coming back areas represent It ’ good feeling That ’ really good feeling.Maybe I ’ Bob finish Do want Roy going say something real fast SENATOR BLUNT I going say like AK Steel need careful There one American producer lots American buyers Those electric motors washing machine generators grid — dependent currently lot electric steel coming somewhere else.I think balance keeping company business —THE PRESIDENT It ’ good balance.SENATOR BLUNT — keep companies — ’ going take long time either expand competitors So need thoughtful buyers product one American source So great example ’ great example remember washing machine motor well things electric steel used sir.THE PRESIDENT That ’ good point The word “ balance ” important word.SENATOR BROWN Can I add one point —THE PRESIDENT Yes go ahead.SENATOR BROWN — taking Roy said As apply — Secretary Ross apply 232 — I understand cautionary notes colleagues — I think ’ important always keep mind China ’ excess capacity And China ’ excess capacity ’ mean aim 232 China Because China ’ excess capacity point spread elsewhere And best example comment oil country tubular steel Korea As Rob said Korea ’ drill It ’ pass-through point.But China ’ excess capacity ways affected steel production — steel sales production — throughout world ’ important 232 aimed China ’ excess capacity countries world.THE PRESIDENT Right I agree Maybe could — brief discussion NAFTA Because group interested NAFTA.AMBASSADOR LIGHTHIZER Well I ’ spoken members And Mr. President I think ’ making progress NAFTA There lot anxiety one point whether ’ position would withdraw order get good agreement.Our view number one NAFTA served United States well respects It served people well people overall done good job I think ’ making real headway I feel like particularly respect Mexicans making headway We number issues still work way I ’ hopeful ’ positon — I think important — get good deal one ’ find acceptable.But importantly I want agreement vast majority Republicans Democrats support I think important new paradigm steel get 20 25 Democrats Senate large number House vote deal well Of course inaudible I think ’ much reach ’ something do.THE PRESIDENT Well I want thank everybody much I really would like see come back counterproposal infrastructure I think ’ going get done I really believe ’ — ’ going get lot Democrats ’ going get lot Republicans We ’ going get done It ’ something We fix country We fix roads tunnels bridges everything.So work together And I ready willing able It ’ important.And course week I know ’ working hard DACA Everybody room wants DACA And let ’ see get done would great achievement They ’ talking many years could would great achievement And would something — humane-basis would excellent.So I want thank If suggestions call call Gary call Wilbur call Bob But I much appreciate And ’ necessary ’ another meeting iron points.But infrastructure natural us get done I think probably it.Thank much Thank you.END 12:37 P.M.
