billion But ’ going invest total 350 billion And I first heard number I said “ You ’ mean billion mean 350 million. ” Because I ’ saying Tim Cook “ Tim got build plants here. ” You know 350 million

charge nothing But send Harley-Davidson motorbike countries charge us 100 percent tax That ’ fair So ’ send motorbikes something us — zero We send — 100 percent That ’ fair trade That ’ fair.So I like word “ reciprocal. ” If ’ going us ’ going And ’ going happen numbers going either come ’ going make lot money And either one okay far I ’ concerned.We rebuild crumbling infrastructure streamline
