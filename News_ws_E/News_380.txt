represents Thurgood Marshall.My tragedy started September 20th last year I two twin sons attend Thurgood Marshall elite athletes junior Olympics One sons youth council member District Columbia Ward 5 And one day — school Now need — I agree need protect kids schools need protect safe passageways home well extracurricular activities parks recreations everything try go peace in.So son Zaire Kelly went college-bound — right school — announce declaring college run track education become mayor District Columbia something like that.On route home got text son Zion Kelly going make found press decided Because locally burnt press Zion texting Zaire “ Watch ’ someone passageway coming home. ” And split second Zaire walking home maybe distance curtains — close home — thug came try rob Zion

community affected And local politicians say “ So want stand students community give us solutions do. ” So along helping hands D.C. came together got attorneys And everyone else said okay ’ going research find legislation found better serve protect students safety zones school zones.And ’ fight everybody show photo ops All politicians show say “ We going get done We going protect kids. ” But couple weeks later school shooting like hearing experiences Ballou Senior High School — kid gets shot school Dunbar — kid gets shot school In schools safe passageway home Their parks recreations extracurricular Our students protected Our students protected.One local legislator asked define students How would criminal define students You would define commit crime The students crying They ’ calling national stand-out day April 20th celebration Columbine — incidents keep happening schools — communities well — upstanding citizens ’ right thing.And parents yes ’ trying fight pass legislation like locally But nationally campaign grown ’ affecting us kids gun violence — gun violence.So I thank That ’ story And ’ going keep fighting ’ going keep trying pass legislation ’ going keep fighting students Thurgood Marshall District Columbia across America well.THE PRESIDENT Thank much It ’ incredible Very sad Thank much.Does anybody idea solution school shooting school shootings ’ gone years And ’ seen much ’ going stop We got lot different ideas I could name 10 right Does anybody idea stop What recommendation stop Yes.MR ABT I ’ know I ’ going say something ’ already heard You know I could tell addition sorrow feeling community right ’ also lot anger Anger police visit person dozens times take action Anger FBI could get least two credible tips take action.And one possible solution ’ discussed Secretary DeVos lunch tragedy strikes wait first responders get campus four five six seven minutes later And one possible solution may popular would people school — teachers administrators — volunteered firearm safely locked classroom given training throughout year.There plenty teachers already licensed carry firearms Have raise hands volunteer training And something like starts first responders already campus And ’ teachers could people work campus A custodian could undercover policeman Someone works library lunchroom could undercover policeman He serves lunch every day also firearm ready A guidance counselor.If ’ stop happening hundreds millions guns I ’ know ever fully stopped But challenge becomes starts end quickly possible.And unfortunately ’ wait five six seven minutes And daughter said earlier 32 states laws require schools prepare yet half county — Broward County one — school prepared And thank God 17 lives But half counties ’ spend money budget training even though laws says many next time So schools train lockdowns possibly armed personnel — staff — willing —PARTICIPANT Anonymously.MR ABT Yeah anonymously I ’ want kids know firearms I ’ want shooters know firearms I ’ want people walking around firearms side But alert goes put kids closets put kids desks I want teacher open safe pull firearm ready needs done ’ waiting helicopters SWAT teams come.MRS BLANK I also agree I also think need deputies You campus Stoneman Douglas I think thirty-three —PARTICIPANT 3,200.MRS BLANK 3,200 one deputy One And deputy leaves training need another deputy there.THE PRESIDENT Yeah.MRS BLANK And thing communication Your schools communicate police The police communicate child services Child services maybe communicate FBI ’ — someone bring — buy gun 18 I understand like even background 15 minutes — able communicate people something wrong child ’ belong — buy gun like this.PARTICIPANT Mr. President.THE PRESIDENT You ’ right Yes go ahead.PARTICIPANT Mr. Vice President Madam Secretary thank us I think ’ hearing today ’ lack solutions I think ’ today lack leadership And I confidence bring leadership need finally take action needs taken ’ one solution ’ many solutions And ’ hearing today resolve address this.Our schools soft targets So need harden targets making — increasing deterrence capabilities potential murderer knows ’ going happen ’ going people ready respond That minute something happens technology pick incident occurred response immediately And also children teachers know instance — ’ communicated effectively.What need identify mental issues among student population The kids school knew person They knew issue The FBI knew I think need close loopholes background check system ’ integrating effectively mental health knowledge exists state level local level federal background check system.So fix NICS system And ’ easy one So ’ lot immediate steps take right ’ longer-term solution But I think need get started right away And I thank help this.THE PRESIDENT Well thank And I say background checks going strong We need And see ’ trouble nab them.You know years ago mental hospitals — mental institutions We lot lot closed They ’ closed Some people thought stigma Some people thought frankly — legislators thought expensive.Today catch somebody ’ know He ’ committed crime may well And ’ mental institution ’ place bring And lot Even caught person — I ’ nice I use word “ person ” — probably ’ known They ’ going put jail And yet — ’ none middle ground institution trained people could handle something find sick really Because sick guy And nabbed number times frankly.Your concept idea — ’ called concealed carry — works people adept using firearms many would teachers coaches If coach firearm locker ran guy — coach brave Saved lot lives I suspect But firearm ’ run would shot would end it.And would obviously people adept handling gun And would — ’ called concealed carry teacher would concealed gun They ’ go special training And would would longer gun-free zone A gun-free zone maniac — ’ cowards — gun-free zone let ’ go let ’ attack bullets ’ coming back us.And — lot people talking ’ certainly point ’ discuss — concealed carry teachers people talent — type talent So let ’ say 20 percent teaching force ’ pretty much number — said — attack lasted average three minutes It takes five eight minutes responders police come So attack If teacher — adept firearms could well end attack quickly.And good thing suggestion like — ’ going looking strongly I think lot people going opposed I think lot people going like — good thing ’ lot people You know ’ hundred security guards Stoneman Douglas That ’ big school That ’ massive school lot acreage cover lot floor area.And would certainly situation discussed lot lot people You ’ lot people ’ armed They ’ ready They ’ professionals They may Marines left Marines left Army left Air Force And ’ adept You ’ lot ’ spread evenly throughout school.So thing — I really believe cowards knew school well-guarded standpoint pretty much professionals great training I think ’ go school start I think could well solve problem.So ’ background checks We ’ lot different things But ’ certainly looking ideas like that.You know lot people ’ understand airline pilots lot carry guns And I say things changed lot People ’ attacking way would routinely attack And maybe situation schools.So anybody like idea Does anybody like Right Yes For Meadow — beautiful Meadow We talked that.And people feel strongly Anybody Anybody Strongly All right I mean I could — look understand sides And certainly ’ controversial But ’ study along many ideas.Anybody else something say Yes go ahead.MR SCOTT I ’ thousands schools across America I ’ noticed Israel one-guard entry points And ’ well guarded.I ’ asking us inaudible I ’ saying turn schools prisons But I ’ many schools I ’ speaking auditorium I ’ go outside call wife get breath fresh air easy get back school I ’ unknown adult many students I tap window ’ open door Or I catch someone coming side door easily get in.So one things I thought lot seeing around country really soft entry points schools.THE PRESIDENT That ’ true That ’ true And something that.Yes sir Go ahead.MR THOMPSON Good afternoon I ’ Brandon Thompson First heart goes everyone ’ experiencing tragedy right I ’ currently dean students Friendship Tech Prep heart Southeast D.C. Ward 8 one impoverished wards D.C.However school solution actually checkpoints When student walks door actually metal detectors And I oftentimes see urban education And actually x-ray machine students put bags And right incident happened parent ’ much agree first sent email saying “ Thank Because I see exactly ’ happening. ” And oftentimes use TSA model When student comes somebody door greet check see feel And certain point people I know person feeling well ’ get past point one They go metal detector bag goes machine And end day talking students riding today say “ Well I feel safe. ” And come outside said talk mental hospitals — school right across street shutdown mental hospital.We — know come streets would like “ Oh God. ” But get inside building family feel We check-in points We every visitor comes building go checkpoints ensure students get home safe ensure staff members get home safe.And minor solutions Like I say I ’ teacher gun building Teachers emotional People emotional So I think huge factor however But students — may go staff members — going checkpoints ensure one mental point two ’ talking ’ physical metal and/or — even building students ’ even carry cell phones consider ’ threat It ’ taking away learning So actually turn cell phones.And things ensuring kids moment live moment enjoy school — get joy factor They get family feel And ’ able connect one another able communicate worry looking shoulder walk building Because know every person comes building metal check — bags checked.And ’ solution Once heart goes everyone tragedy.THE PRESIDENT Thank Very well said Very well said Yes.MS HOCKLEY Mr. President thank open hearing forms solutions I truly appreciate that.One point mental health issue — I think ’ important note someone mental illness highly unlikely ever commit act violence It ’ small percentage.What ’ really dealing lack mental wellness This around anger fear And ’ something diagnose put mental health hospitals This funding mental health services help individuals risk especially think suicide teen suicide Suicide number two killer children I understand right And lot suicides performed firearms makes unsaveable.So idea mental health able identify ’ risk ’ considering issues ’ going crisis incredibly important.I appreciate point arming teachers It ’ personally something I support Rather arm firearm I would rather arm knowledge prevent acts happening first place How identify kids class risk And importantly within school safety assessment program schools know deal threats established protocols deal get underneath surface ’ going child ’ life find ’ pathway behavior intervene This prevention There fabulous solutions talked today still go imminent danger Let ’ talk prevention There much help people reaches point And I urge please stay focused well It gun ’ person behind gun ’ helping people ever reach point.THE PRESIDENT Yes go ahead Thank you.MR ZEIF So I fully respect amendments including Second But Maryland proven Second Amendment protect types weapons They banned 45 different kinds assault weapons including AR Including AR They banned — limited magazine sizes.They proven ’ like lose Second

HUNTER POLLACK I would like talk Mr. President I ’ agree — I ’ debate I lost sister And like Mr. President said could find 20 percent maybe retired law enforcement officers teachers could go discreet training carry firearm waist could different situation.Like said law enforcement takes seven minutes eight minutes get If teacher security guard concealed license firearm waist ’ able easily stop situation bad guy — I ’ way — would even go near school knowing someone fight back them.Also I believe insanity would even open gates 20 minutes school ends They ’ supposed protect us children So future need security need firearms campus need better background checks need study mental health.And I want thank everyone condolences And ’ argument Thank you.THE PRESIDENT Thank much Thank you.Yes
