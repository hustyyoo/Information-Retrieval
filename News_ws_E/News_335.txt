Vice President thank much Thank taking seriously Our hearts go Parkland We know gone Sandy Hook community never ever same.And I want bring us back issue background checks I could I think ’ real opportunity.THE PRESIDENT I agree.SENATOR MURPHY There issue American public today like background checks Ninety-seven percent Americans want universal background checks In states universal background checks 35 percent less gun murders states ’ And yet ’ get done There ’ nothing else like works people want ’ it.THE PRESIDENT But different President now.SENATOR MURPHY Well listen —THE PRESIDENT You went lot Presidents ’ get done You different President And I think maybe different attitude I think people want get done.SENATOR MURPHY Well listen end Mr. President reason nothing gotten done gun lobby veto power legislation comes Congress I wish ’ case And end stuff gun industry supports ’ worth We going make difference.And I ’ glad ’ sat NRA get 60 votes bill looks like Manchin-Toomey compromise background checks Mr. President support If come Congress come Republicans say “ We going Manchin-Toomey-like bill get comprehensive background checks ” pass But meeting ends sort vague notions future compromise nothing happen.THE PRESIDENT I agree We ’ want that.SENATOR MURPHY And I think unique opportunity get comprehensive background checks make sure nobody buys gun country ’ criminal ’ seriously mentally ill ’ terrorist watch list But Mr. President ’ going brings Republicans table right gun lobby would stop tracks.THE PRESIDENT I like responsibility Chris I really I think ’ time It ’ time President stepped ’ And I ’ talking Democrat Republican Presidents — stepped up.And maybe I call Marco I ’ like Pat Toomey Joe Manchin Could sort detail bill Because I heard lot actually.SENATOR TOOMEY Thank much Absolutely Mr. President And I think bill best chance moving forward We got 54 votes 2013 — bill space got It several components.The first title title similar John Cornyn Chris Murphy ’ bill It strengthens reporting information background checks.THE PRESIDENT Can merge SENATOR TOOMEY Absolutely Easily.THE PRESIDENT It ’ better — one bill nicer seven bills.SENATOR TOOMEY Right The second part provision would require background checks commercial sales See one big gaps background check system today sales gun shows sales Internet necessarily subject background check think These essentially commercial nature ’ scale really matters So bill would require background checks.We also number provisions ’ —THE PRESIDENT Do support SENATOR TOOMEY For THE PRESIDENT Do bipartisan support ’ saying SENATOR TOOMEY We 54 votes 2013 And 54 voters still Senate.THE PRESIDENT And ’ lot presidential backup SENATOR TOOMEY President Obama support But —THE PRESIDENT But problem.SENATOR TOOMEY But worry wanted go frankly concern guys.I ’ say ’ two items One list ways law-abiding citizen could greater freedom exercise Second Amendment instance allowing active-duty military person able buy firearm home state Today ’ law It ’ Our bill would correct A number small things.THE PRESIDENT Positives inaudible .SENATOR TOOMEY And finally create commission look sources causes terrible mass killings.THE PRESIDENT What schools SENATOR MANCHIN We school safety program bill also When I governor fixed lot schools We remodeled schools built schools one student ever inaudible said “ Governor Manchin ’ got make sure first-floor windows bullet-proof. ” We never knew No one ever came concern And ’ inaudible Sandy Hook shot way in.So made sure addressed Mr. President difference ’ person West Virginia believes ’ going defend Second Amendment rights — person With taking lead something like gives comfort something reasonable — bill vetted five years 70 80 percent even gun owners say “ We like bill Pat Joe ’ afraid President Obama would take take rights away. ” That ’ I running West Virginia.THE PRESIDENT Or use excuse sign But Schumer proactive getting bill signed fairness.SENATOR MANCHIN Well — fairness bill basically support would pass It would pass And think — basically takes commercial sales Any commercial transfer —THE PRESIDENT And maybe — bill use base could add things going said room may want But going things going said today I think — know addition John add almost everything know involves I think would positive thing terms background checks.SENATOR MANCHIN If I could say Mr. President —THE PRESIDENT Go ahead.SENATOR MANCHIN On piece legislation without background checks commercial transactions — person basically terrorists basically say “ Hey go local gun show get whatever want ” gun show two-thirds gun show could licensed dealer — federal licensed dealers background checks buy If go next table one It ’ loophole Interstate intrastate If ’ selling outside state Internet background check If sell state one part New York versus ’ This closes loopholes.THE PRESIDENT We could work And something mentally ill able buy gun I mean many checks balances could mentally ill takes six months prohibit So something decisive Number one take guns away immediately people adjudge easily mentally ill like guy You know police saw — problem ’ take guns away Now could policing I think taken way anyway whether right not.But I ’ tell You strong provisions mentally ill. Now lot people saying oh I ’ saying I ’ tell — I ’ want mentally ill people guns.Marco.SENATOR RUBIO Mr. President thanks bringing us I think agree — know issues fought issue I think everyone agrees never want see happen anywhere America.And mentioned something shooting I think critical This multi-systemic failure And without pointing fingers laying blame anyone particular may may defend — sheriff ’ office knew problem The school districts knew problem The FBI alerted problem The Department Children Families Florida knew problem But big problem none talked Nobody told others knew.And bill Senator Hatch going file soon Congressman Rutherford others already filed ’ call STOP School Violence Act And I ’ let describe detail But one things incentivizes creation sort synergy people talking compare notes get ahead this.The best way prevent stop even starts That ’ mean ’ harden schools That ’ mean debate issues But best thing happen know people get get services need deny right buy gun.And I think something holds tremendous bipartisan promise come together things agree on.And I would say one last point In state Florida different process But already moving legislation Governor legislature They ’ going pass something perhaps end week series things move lot slower But nonetheless I think ’ example us I hope Washington — get done agree We still debate try act things things agree We owe families things.THE PRESIDENT I agree Marco Chuck anything SENATOR GRASSLEY Yeah I would like comment standpoint First caution mental health ’ lot people mental health issues dangerous others So I think got concentrate mental health issues ones show danger others — otherwise ’ fair people mental illness ’ t.I ’ comment culture within schools I ’ say better Senator Rubio say Senator Hatch say But seems culture schools people attuned people problems could create massacre sort things anything else even connected bullying.As one example things federal level give schools resources So

riding streets Jacksonville Florida I tell one things I learned 41 years lot room tell well security always multilayered approach So talk background checks buy gun — things important And parts security create country.But know — said All break someone go gun-free zone kill — will.THE PRESIDENT Defenseless John.REPRESENTATIVE RUTHERFORD Defenseless people.THE PRESIDENT Yeah defenseless.REPRESENTATIVE RUTHERFORD So number one security law enforcement perspective — thing — sounds cliché ’ cliché ’ true The thing stops bad gun gun good guy gun.THE PRESIDENT So true.REPRESENTATIVE RUTHERFORD And officers armed security schools.Now issue — talk areas guns The reason I carry concealed firearm everywhere I go I ’ know gun-free zones I may walking mall donut shop wherever I might be.So ’ I carry concealed I protect I protect family might I protect around choose carry firearm.THE PRESIDENT But ’ allowed concealed gun-free zone.REPRESENTATIVE RUTHERFORD Well —THE PRESIDENT So REPRESENTATIVE RUTHERFORD You ’ carry areas And ’ —THE PRESIDENT You ’ experienced one — maybe.REPRESENTATIVE RUTHERFORD I mean I ’ like everybody else.THE PRESIDENT Great —REPRESENTATIVE RUTHERFORD So ’ —THE PRESIDENT They dangerous places gun-free zones.REPRESENTATIVE RUTHERFORD Exactly.THE PRESIDENT It ’ true.REPRESENTATIVE RUTHERFORD And ’ need look I think going back concealed carry issue national reciprocity.THE PRESIDENT I ’ think ’ going get approved Look ’ going get concealed carry approved.Amy Dianne —SENATOR FEINSTEIN You ’ right.THE PRESIDENT — lot people — people — ’ never going consider But people may consider ’ going consider bill All ’ going mean —REPRESENTATIVE RUTHERFORD But ’ want away gun-free zones.THE PRESIDENT As far I ’ concerned I would And I would military.REPRESENTATIVE RUTHERFORD Because gun-free zone goes away I walk in.THE PRESIDENT In fact I ’ looking get rid gun-free zones military We military bases gun-free zones And five incredible soldiers three championship shooters nowhere near gun whack job walked killed And defenseless And guns would gone second.REPRESENTATIVE RUTHERFORD And every time I walk place carrying concealed I end gun-free zone — whether ’ restaurant whether ’ grocery store wherever might be.THE PRESIDENT Well I want get rid military bases start know ’ happened there.REPRESENTATIVE RUTHERFORD And let close mental health piece I think critical law enforcement.We actually take folks danger others Baker Act — Florida ’ called Baker Act ’ crisis stabilization process They ’ three days 72 hours They get stabilized get give guns back I tried one time actually got sued lost case Had give guns back got fined.So state Florida bill mentioned earlier Senate passed It risk protection orders built them.THE PRESIDENT That ’ right.REPRESENTATIVE RUTHERFORD And ’ states already I believe And I think going critical law enforcement help take guns hands individuals know carrying.And need make sure individuals get placed National Background Check System.THE PRESIDENT Right.SENATOR KLOBUCHAR And Mr. President Vice President ’ state Indiana done good job that.THE PRESIDENT Yes Go ahead Mike.THE VICE PRESIDENT Well category spoke Mr. President — gun violence restraining orders And ’ called — California actually version And I think meeting governors earlier week individually group spoke states taking steps.But focus literally give families give local law enforcement additional tools individual reported potential danger others Allow due process one ’ rights trampled But ability go court obtain order collect firearms weapons possession individual.THE PRESIDENT Or Mike take firearms first go court ’ another system Because lot times time go court takes long go court get due process procedures.I like taking guns early like crazy man ’ case took place Florida He lot firearms They saw everything To go court would taken long time So could exactly ’ saying take guns first go due process second.THE VICE PRESIDENT We think tragedy Sandy Hook —THE PRESIDENT That ’ right That ’ right.THE VICE PRESIDENT — Adam Lanza ’ mother spoke law enforcement spoke local officials She concerned I know colleagues Connecticut lived saw it.But literally give families tools law enforcement — state done states done — able take action remove weapons either set period time longer make sure person ’ threat.THE PRESIDENT I like Marco.SENATOR RUBIO And add obviously ’ state law provision And I know ’ people working federal level incentivize states But states allowed right And hopefully Florida shortly.And brings home point Vice President alluded Congressman Rutherford touched well people tried something They called FBI called sheriff ’ office But legally recourse sort get ahead stop terms taking away guns placing facility measure court order prevent able And even law enforcement gone see would limited ultimately options well.So idea states And I think –there may something incentivize I know ’ talking office Senator Blumenthal others But ultimately states way multiple states already done And hopefully Florida will.SENATOR CORNYN Mr. President 21st Century Cures bill Senator Murphy I worked part involved Mental Health Safe Communities Act We provided additional grants jurisdictions used assisted outpatient treatments This sort variation Vice President talked about.Adam Lanza ’ mother ’ compliant medications ’ follow doctor ’ orders needed help could go court — civil court — get court order forced take medication follow doctor ’ orders Many people mental illness could — take medication compliant function productively society.So variety tools ’ one ’ already law addition states doing.THE PRESIDENT So let ask Chris John better one-off bill merge Joe Pat ’ bill Because I like much better comprehensive bill Some people ’ like word “ comprehensive ” talk I like word “ comprehensive. ” You know say “ Oh ’ bad word represents things. ” I mean I like word “ comprehensive. ” I ’ rather comprehensive bill.Can merge bill would rather separate Fix NICS bill SENATOR CORNYN Mr. President important thing said outset act.THE PRESIDENT You act.SENATOR

going get done.SENATOR MURPHY I think add anything Fix NICS 60 votes And I think argument background checks added support.And Mr. President I would add I hope follow data Because data going tell — ’ talked lot safe schools lot mental illness The data tells America gun violence rate 20 times every industrialized country world.But ’ higher mental illness rate schools ’ less safe ’ spend less money law enforcement What ’ different loosest lax gun laws nation.So I ’ everything But fix mental illness system ’ broken period Stop Not think ’ going solve gun violence —THE PRESIDENT Have You folks.SENATOR MURPHY We got — data tells us one thing different United States unbelievably loose gun laws And I hope follow it.REPRESENTATIVE RUTHERFORD And ’ background checks ’ data.SENATOR MURPHY
