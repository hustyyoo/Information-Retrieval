turn trade I could My understanding Prime Minister came message European Union Commission President saying put tariffs steel aluminum ’ slap back punitive tariffs bourbon jeans motorcycles talk Wisconsin Are still planning going ahead tariffs There people party suggested ’ good idea.And Prime Minister Löfven ’ perspective tariffs And message convey President Sweden European Union Thank you.PRESIDENT TRUMP Well United States taken advantage countries friendly friendly many many decades And trade deficit 800 billion year ’ going happen We mistreated many sometimes fairly really instances ’ taken place.And I ’ blame countries I blame leadership allowing happen When I President Xi China — example lose 500 billion year trade We deficit approximately 500 billion year China And ’ things China strong understand But I I said public I said “ Look I ’ blaming I blame people better job allowing happen. ” But ’ like many countries small — European Union particularly tough United States They make almost impossible us business yet send cars everything else back United States And whatever ’ like put big tax 25 percent cars And believe ’ long The European Union treated us well ’ unfair trade situation.I ’ protect And one reasons I elected I ’ protecting workers I ’ protecting companies And I ’ going let happen.So ’ tariffs steel We lose steel industry It ’ fraction And ’ lose aluminum industry Also fraction was.And country well The massive tax cuts deregulation really kicked us gear But I work trade deals We ’ working NAFTA right And ’ able make deal Canada Mexico NAFTA reason tariffs Canada Mexico.But countries ’ choice unless something us As example European Union takes horrible barriers make impossible product go start talking Otherwise ’ going leave way is.So fact ’ mistreated country many years ’ going happen longer.Q How avoid escalating — avoid escalating trade war PRESIDENT TRUMP Well ’ see You know ’ behind every single country trade wars ’ bad You understand I mean When ’ 30 billion 40 billion 60 billion 100 billion trade war hurts ’ hurt us So ’ see happens.You know also take — cases lose trade plus give military ’ subsidizing tremendously So lose trade lose military hence massive deficit numbers country We ’ going straighten And ’ loving way It loving loving way They ’ like us better respect us much Because even say — right say “ We ’ believe ’ gotten away. ” I mean two countries said “ We believe honest ’ gotten away long. ” Now one made statement I got elected He said “ I ’ believe I made statement I got elected. ” But ’ one things.We straighten We really choice.Q And Mr. Prime Minister forceful message President consequences goes ahead tariffs PRIME MINISTER LÖFVEN First trade European Union mandate ’ member European Union It ’ European mandate handle trade issues But member European Union I think ’ important us try find way cooperate European Union United States.I fully understand respect President ’ view look country — country ’ leading I fully That ’ primary task well.But leading small country depending open trade best way us others export equals 50 percent GDP So us crucially important open free trade.Today also I believe supply chains complicated see I know example sell fighter aircraft good aircraft content perhaps 50 percent American So want resolved cooperation And comes steel yes overcapacity world That ’ obvious But time China producing 50 percent steel world European Union perhaps 10 percent less that.So summarize I think pity Again ’ European Union mandate But pity also T-TIP negotiations ended perhaps negotiations talks come situation European Union United States cooperate I think would good solution.PRESIDENT TRUMP Just add maybe little bit If talk China I ’ watched reporters writing 2 percent steel comes China Well ’ right They transship countries And ’ see country ’ even steel mill sending us 3 percent steel country And many countries comes China.So China ’ send us 2 percent send us much much higher level But ’ called transshipping So ’ look good comes China send countries comes us And ’ putting steel mills business Our aluminum mills going business And need steel need aluminum.And know ’ theory country ’ steel ’ country And ’ true So pure economics This defense This country itself.But remember We lose 800 billion year trade And I think I elected least partially issue And I ’ saying 25 years — country taken advantage everybody By everybody Almost everybody And let happen longer companies importantly workers So ’ going let happen.Please.PRIME MINISTER LÖFVEN Okay Tina TT News Agency.Q So Mr. President thank hosting us You mentioned Sweden helped United States North Korea How see collaboration future create future
