infrastructure investment American history The framework generate unprecedented 1.5- 1.7-trillion investment American infrastructure We ’ going lot public-private That way gets done time budget.It speed permit approval process 10 years 2 years maybe even 1 year Because give U.S. governors mayors people representing great states — give money ’ get approvals I guess ’ going take money back ’

standpoint environmentally everything — I see Scott — ’ going get permits quickly.It provides 50 billion rural infrastructure really left — rural folks left including broadband Internet access ’ And want farmers want It create thousands thousands jobs increase training great American workers returns power state local governments know best people need.Washington longer roadblock progress Washington partner We ’ partner A lot money — 1.7 trillion That ’ bigger people thought And ’ going lot great people working We ’ going also great companies investing building ’ build sometimes states
