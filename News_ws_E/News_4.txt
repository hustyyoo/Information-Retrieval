beyond The first topic Iran You said front press position campaign well President United States It ’ mystery starting positions stances neither I habit changing stances going wind.That said I say ’ frank discussion two us You consider Iranian deal JCPOA — one negotiated 2015 Iran — bad deal For number months I ’ saying sufficient deal enabled us least 2025 control nuclear activities.We therefore wish work new deal Iran What need — I believe discussions allowed us shed light convergence views — need cover four topics.The first one block nuclear activity Iran 2025 This feasible thanks JCPOA The second make sure long run nuclear Iranian activity The third fundamental topic able put end ballistic activities Iran region And fourth one generate conditions solution — political solution contain Iran region — Yemen Syria Iraq Lebanon.On topics I change I constantly said needed find framework together powers region Iranian leaders manage find deal I therefore would like us commit effect weeks months come.This way bring stability France naïve comes Iran We also lot respect Iranian people history — history — always shown strength.But want repeat mistakes past Each time tried unilaterally replace sovereignty people brought terror But allies want sustainable stability And I believe discussions ’ together make possible open way pave way new agreement agreement work And beyond European partners would like involve regional powers course Russia Turkey.It also within framework matter finding together — together long run find solution Syrian situation In Syria together engaged within international coalition Daesh terrorists And continue act end within framework victory.That said long run need win peace make sure Syria fall hegemony region So effect approach — agreed — means work work situation — whole situation — region efforts contain Iran region.We continue work effect within U.N. Security Council make sure humanitarian law prohibition chemical weapons fully complied And continue shoulder responsibilities effect But also work partners building sustainable political solution inclusive one prevent hegemony prevent feeding terrorism future.We also talked climate And also know stand France continue work major pieces including global compact environment But I think I say economic — businesses researchers continue work — create solutions field And attached that.Now trade like mentioned I hear said call upon fair equitable trade When look international trade today common challenges There over-capacities number sectors well known shall work together make sure destabilize markets bring unfair competition.But I believe say attached make sure allies ’ compliance international trade law At least France attached We preferences There situations probably improve But I believe I also attached — want make sure businesses companies operate long sustainable stable framework.Mr President I meant mention points commented well And allow say discussions ’ today — ones tomorrow — fed strength historical bonds also sincere friendship I believe share.So thank Mr.

TRUMP I like lot Laughter First I want thank — I want thank Vice President Karen Thank much Appreciate it.Now wonderful conference today I think especially one-on-one Oval office — covered lot territory trade Iran various subjects So I think lot good things going come meeting I appreciate here.I take couple questions How Jeff Mason Reuters Jeff Hi Jeff.Q Thank Mr. President Hi After discussions today President Macron thinking timeline bringing U.S. troops Syria And one topic mentioned today thought leader North Korea behaved openly honorably This someone many people accused starving people killing family members What mean called PRESIDENT TRUMP Well start second part question And I hope able deal open honorable fashion North Korea I started process I everybody thought I absolutely wrong But meantime 25 years people dealing nothing happened And lot happening right I tell Jeff A lot happening And I think ’ going positive And I hope ’ going positive North Korea South Korea Japan rest world.But I starting level frankly I ’ start This worked long time ago This worked many years ago We discussing ’ situation happen United States world This resolved Presidents leaders countries long time ago.With said I think ’ well Meetings set And I want see denuclearization North Korea A lot concessions already made We made concessions despite media saying I ’ made concessions I ’ — I ’ even discussed concession fact meeting great thing And I ’ sure lot people would liked position ’ having.I say We put strongest sanctions country ever put country far China President Xi strong helping us solve problem — case border He ’ allowing little get through.I think ’ number reasons We good relationship also ’ important terms trade I play trade card If look ’ happening trade China ’ fair many many years United States ’ going solve problem In fact ’ Secretary Mnuchin couple folks heading — Bob Lighthizer — heading China request China They came know last week And ’ substantive discussions trade.But I think plays border fact extremely strong border little gotten much surprise lot people And I believe trade work I also think China never treated us respect last short period time I ’ President I excellent know relationship President Xi And I think relationship important ’ happening North Korea.So end result ’ see Maybe good things happen maybe ’ wasting lot time But hopefully good everybody concerned.As far Syria concerned I would love get I ’ love bring incredible warriors back home They ’ done great job We ’ essentially absolutely obliterated ISIS Iraq Syria And ’ done big favor neighboring countries frankly ’ also done favor country.With said Emmanuel discussed fact ’ want give Iran open season Mediterranean especially since really control To large extent really controlled ’ set control So ’ see happens.But ’ going coming home relatively soon We finished least almost work respect ISIS Syria ISIS Iraq done job nobody able do.But said I want come home But I want come home also accomplished accomplish So discussing Syria part overall deal When made Iran deal done included Syria When I say “ ” — giving Iran 150 billion 1.8 billion cash — 1.8 million cash You think Before giving kind tremendous money okay — 150 billion 1.8 billion cash — barrels I hear taken boxes taken — cash — made deal covered Yemen covered Syria covered parts Middle East Iraq — Iran involved They ’ that.So want come home We ’ coming home But want strong — want leave strong lasting footprint big part discussion Okay Thank you.Q And follow I may sir On North Korea said believe complete denuclearization What mean exactly PRESIDENT TRUMP It means get rid nukes Very simple They get rid nukes nobody else would say It would easy make simple deal claim victory I ’ want I want get rid nukes.Q And President Macron President referred earlier meetings Cabinet Room potential deal two Iran Can give us sense might And confident assurances President Trump European Union excluded tariffs steel aluminum PRESIDENT MACRON Look second question President answer But I want trade issue clear When look trade issue two countries balanced There unbalanced relationship.Second following respecting WTO rules one contributed creation WTO think makes sense respect rule decided create In general life ’ good method.And third I believe inaudible issue trade over-capacities steel aluminum ’ come Europe even France And ’ good work together allies especially work closely together security issues like Iran Syria.So I ’ confident future trade relationship I think ’ part broader picture interests totally aligned.As Iranian situation I think I detailed introduction key pillars new approach want adopt And ’ exactly President Trump said We nuclear short run nuclear long run We ballistic activity We regional presence Iran We want fix situation four pillars.Syria part fourth one And work obviously Iran different parties region P5 allies find fair deal fix overall situation This way preserve sovereignty region build peace long run Otherwise come back region new terrorist groups sure.And I ’ happy discussion together raised new issues new solutions together especially fact Syrian crisis Syrian situation part broader picture And fact today Syria together international coalition ISIS tomorrow find way fix situation political point view automatically military point view Which means set series agreements part big deal order sure Syria tomorrow sovereign country inclusiveness free people situation decide future This important ’ duty.PRESIDENT TRUMP And I think great shot much bigger maybe deal maybe deal We ’ going find ’ know fairly soon.Mr President PRESIDENT MACRON As interpreted A question French press.Q As interpreted A question Agence France-Presse behalf French press As inaudible Mr. President saying plan B Iran deal preserved Now ’ talking new deal Iran Why change mind Did join strong approach suggested President Trump Is could convince And addition think others signed agreement deal follow PRESIDENT MACRON As interpreted When I said plan B I usually refer fact B planet It climate rather Iran.Now regarding Iran I ’ always coherent go back I said U.N. General Assembly September I always said JCPOA needed add three pillars post-2025 — ballistic issue regional influence I know President Trump decide regarding JCPOA responsibility.The JCPOA first pillar framework I described So I ’ saying ’ moving one deal another I ’ saying one aspect problem I never critical JCPOA President Trump I believe usefully add it.But matter decision President Trump take I would like work new deal four pillars including already covered JCPOA ongoing nuclear — I mean current nuclear activities longer nuclear activities ballistic activities regional influenceSo constant But past weeks particular today ’ able go much talk details topic including situation region And I believe ’ converged common reading happening Syria Yemen Iraq particular.And fact nuclear issue one indeed problem ballistic activity Iran presence number countries region And willingness indeed set conditions stability region.Once ’ built convergence idea moving new deal would include solution Syria I believe strong step forward thanks discussions ’ today.So I much would like us work together partners And ministers foreign affairs already gathered small group anytime soon The purpose allied powers — amongst — course also regional powers work level small group We also shall privileged discussions Russia Turkey regional topics including Syria So work using method favor — work towards deal.I believe combine common views differences vacuum I always said tear apart JCPOA nothing else I think would — would good solution But placing momentum purpose put together broad agreement covering four topics I mentioned ’ different first take board concerns criticism President Trump regarding deal like I said deal supported former American administration previous American administration.But work also respecting sovereignty states region It ’ intervening matter It rather building stable framework contribute stability peacebuilding And I think ’ agreeing upon today It ’ tearing agreement nothing ’ building something new cover concerns.PRESIDENT TRUMP And I might add states I alluded — countries area immensely wealthy would except United States lesser extent France But ’ except United States They ’ last week We ’ protecting They step pay ’ happening I ’ think France United States liable tremendous cost.The United States embarrassingly Middle East As months ago ’ heard say — I ’ take responsibility I would embarrassed I — 7 trillion And want build Mr. President infrastructure everybody says “ Oh want careful money. ” When want fix highway want build schools lots things — tunnels bridges — say “ Oh let ’ careful money. ” And yet spent 7 trillion Middle East ’ gotten nothing Nothing Less nothing far I ’ concerned That ’ 18-year period.The countries know well immensely wealthy ’ going pay And I think President I agree much And pay They pay We ’ spoken They pay The United States continue pay And also put soldiers ground ’ And fact bring lots people home We strong blockage Mediterranean important — ’ Iran going right Mediterranean Not going that.But chance — nobody knows I ’ going 12th although Mr. President pretty good idea — ’ see But ’ see also I people expect whether possible new deal solid foundations Because deal decayed foundations It ’ bad deal It ’ bad structure It ’ falling Should never ever made I blame Congress I blame lot people But never made ’ going see happens 12th.But I say Iran threatens us way pay price like countries ever paid Okay Yes John Please John Roberts Fox.Q Thank Mr. President I question President Macron well But I could sir first Your nominee run Veterans Affairs Administration Dr. Ronny Jackson run serious political headwinds Capitol Hill serious allegations leveled I ’ wondering know allegations And intend stand behind PRESIDENT TRUMP Well I ’ heard particular allegations I tell ’ one finest people I met I think speaking Melania also He ’ doctor President Obama I believe President Bush I ’ gotten know pretty well He ’ great doctor.And suggestion Now I know ’ experience problem lack experience But ’ experience problem — Veterans Administration important We ’ done great job know Accountability Act many things Now ’ working choice It ’ going happen We ’ going take great care veterans That ’ important thing ’ done great job.But I told Admiral Jackson little ago I said “ What need ” This vicious group people malign — And I ’ lived lived You people getting record ratings congratulations But I said “ What need ” He ’ admiral He ’ great leader And questioned every little thing.As know success hopefully soon Secretary State Pompeo everybody surprised I heard 10 minutes vote yesterday committee “ He approved committee ” — would first time many many decades something like would happened regard Secretary State — except I spoke Rand Paul Rand Paul really never let Rand Paul good man And I knew things nobody else knew And Rand Paul said “ I ’ going change vote ” voted everybody surprised And actually got 11-9 vote know Johnny Isakson ’ vote counts ’ deciding vote So actually 11-9 I believe — one vote — would call John Q A present vote.PRESIDENT TRUMP Not present.Q No No Present.PRESIDENT TRUMP Oh ’ called “ present. ” Okay So 11-9 terrific thing But failed stop So say “ Who ’ next Who ’ next ” And person Admiral Jackson — Dr. Jackson — wonderful man I said “ What need ” And far experience concerned Veterans Administration — approximately 13 million people — big could run biggest hospital system world ’ small time compared Veterans Administration So nobody experience.What leader good man But I told — I said “ You know Doc You ’ fine person. ” His son top student Annapolis He ’ high-quality person I said “ What need ” So ’ making — ’ totally decision — ’ making decision.But failed Mike Pompeo big big hit thought could stop embarrass The Democrats become obstructionists That ’ ’ good They ’ good anything else They bad ideas They bad politics The one thing obstruct And ’ I ’ waiting — would never believe — I ’ waiting good people like Ambassador Germany Hasn ’ approved yet It ’ 11 12 months.We Angela Merkel coming United States Friday We still ’ ambassador approved And rate — many papers checked yesterday actually said I right — would nine years people approved We hundreds people waiting approved Democrats taking 30 hours per person They ’ taking maximum time They obstructions That ’ bad country.I said Dr. Jackson “ What need ” So ’ see happens I ’ want put man ’ political person I ’ want put man process like It ’ ugly disgusting So ’ see happens He ’ make decision.Q So saying Mr. President stand behind —PRESIDENT TRUMP Oh I would definitely stand behind He ’ fine man I ’ always stand behind I ’ let choice.But man extraordinary person His family extraordinary success Great doctor Great everything And listen abuse — I ’ I Actually many ways I ’ love But fact I ’ I ’ What need To abused bunch politicians ’ thinking nicely country I really ’ think personally But ’ totally — I would stand behind — totally decision.Q And Monsieur le Président I could direct question well You said President Trump came agreement way forward Syria U.S. troops really heart solution How long President Macron believe U.S. troops need stay Syria Through defeat ISIS Or need stay stabilization period alternative Assad government stood PRESIDENT MACRON First let say proud honored part international coalition today alongside United States troops order fight ISIS.We decided increase contribution totally involved war ISIS And sure first goal intervention international coalition ground finish work ISIS definitely finish enemies And enemies ISIS terrorist group.Beyond military presence beyond troops ground build I said peace — i.e new inclusive framework — order sure certain people opportunity live peace — different ethnics different religious different groups — sure hegemony region That ’ diplomatic work ’ already started finish This something different.So I would — ’ allow I would separate two issues We — involved ground ISIS We finish war And ’ open new war start new war But time open new war together — ’ decided — order build overall region new framework especially Syria.We assess coming weeks month — ’ probably much end war adapt enemy reality ground So say “ This day leave floor. ” That ’ impossible depend reality ground.But sure want finish war troops And want fix long run situation peace region That ’ duty And ’ troops It ’ diplomats teams common work obviously allies region people involved.PRESIDENT TRUMP We ’ pretty much finished ISIS ’ going making big decisions short period time But ’ working closely together France President Okay Thank much.Q As interpreted Mr. President BFM Television President Macron year ’ enjoyed friendly relationship President Trump Quite unusual compared previous Presidents At time see agree number topics There We ’ seen openly Oval Office earlier Iran It seems like initial deal Iran able saved So relationship Can concrete impact France Can beneficial France Europe You talked reciprocal interests Is really case today PRESIDENT MACRON As interpreted Yes definitely I believe reason enjoy relationship relationship two countries Indeed different background maybe politicians — typical politicians And none us easily change one ’ mind And I think listen press conference watched us answer question.Regarding Iran disagreement regarding JCPOA I think overcoming deciding work towards deal — overall deal enable us deal nuclear issue also treat together another three issues dealt far.So decision — I mean ’ spent hour two us — conclusions United States America would walk away JCPOA France would move friendship would wasted But making sure ’ taking account position interests reciprocal countries.It unprecedented We ’ never taken joint position joint stance Syria way Iran favor deal enable us cover four pillars There intense work teams otherwise would position much.In past sometimes France argued time take action chemical weapons — France followed allies including United States time It happened time We decided together possible What legitimate within international framework two members Security Council conducted unprecedented military intervention unprecedented level cooperation.And please allow pay tribute troops armies United Kingdom ’ led unique operation proportionate one able thanks relation entered.So Syria Iran credibility international community use chemical weapons — ’ seen You evidence showed relationship two countries friendship enable us achieve concrete results And improvement compared stood couple weeks ago.PRESIDENT TRUMP Well I think much common I must say I think many things — certainly things agreed change flexible You know life flexible And leaders countries show flexibility And I think actually get along many subjects discussed today.And I say France great country And I believe France taken new heights President He ’ going outstanding President One great Presidents And ’ honor call friend Thank Applause END1:36 P.M.
