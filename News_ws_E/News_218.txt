Remarks President Trump Law Enforcement Roundtable Sanctuary Cities Remarks Immigration Issued March 20 2018 Roosevelt Room2:17 P.M. EDTTHE PRESIDENT A lot power around table It ’ impressive I honored joined today top law enforcement officials members Congress Secretary Nielsen Attorney General Sessions discuss threat lawless many cases sanctuary cities They ’ causing lot problems country.Sanctuary cities release thousands criminal aliens prisons jails back communities They go sanctuary cities see go feel ’ safe And many cases bad actors We gang members predators rapists killers A lot bad people.To underscore scope threat face last year alone ICE arrested illegal immigrants 48,000 charges convictions assault 11,000 sex crimes 1,800 killing people homicide-related offenses And offenses great ’ even going talk right They great.Last September illegal immigrant arrested San Francisco Police spousal abuse ICE filed detainer individual detainer denied alien released Less 10 days later illegal immigrant arrested murder Many cases like that.In another case alleged illegal gang member arrested San Francisco Police Department 10 times 2013 2017 charges including domestic battery assault theft rape But San Francisco refused cooperate ICE You know well ’ Tom You lot problems And kept getting released Over released Sanctuary cities states like California put innocent Americans mercy hardened criminals hardened murderers many cases.Yet House Senate Democrats voted nearly unanimously favor sanctuary cities Explain We ’ looking safe cities folks Safe cities They ’ also blocking bed space need omnibus stop catch release Catch release We catch killer release We need extra beds ’ release Bed space important It ’ negotiated right now.Democrats ’ priority protect criminals ’ right country My priority priority administration serve protect defend citizens United States.So tremendous people around table people know ’ happening know ’ going on.And maybe Tom I ’ like start You could say words quickly ’ go around table.Thank much.ACTING DIRECTOR HOMAN Thanks inviting important discussion And I ’ proud represent 20,000 American heroes work ICE.As many know ICE recently conducted series plans targeting enforcement operations California jurisdictions longer cooperate federal law enforcement officers thanks statewide sanctuary policy To meet mission conduct operations like across country every day They based intelligence-driven leads.So let clear There raids sweeps Everybody arrest targeted enforcement operation We know exactly ’ going arrest exactly ’ going find time.In fiscal year 2017 example people say ’ prioritize re-arrest 81 percent aliens arrested California last year convicted criminals We also prioritize fugitives aliens illegally reentered United States felony mere fact reentering formally removed.But let clear As I ’ said many times ’ crime enter state — enter United States illegally It ’ Title 8 code And ICE officers ’ condemned ’ upholding sworn oath enforcing laws Congress enacted.We told one hand focus efforts criminals But folks want us focus criminals ’ let us county jail It defies logic Concentrate criminals ’ come county jail.As result many officers forced make arrests community Ask law enforcement officer — got many sitting around table — arresting public safety threat turf access weapons significant danger men women ICE law enforcement officers.Many local law enforcement officers — partners California — table also oppose dangerous policies sanctuary — policies imposed Sacramento including California State Sherriff ’ Association They disagreed governor They come press statement saying ’ allowed communicate ICE way want release public safety threats public ’ want do.Following passage SB-54 issued statement Let quote This comes California State Sherriff ’ Association “ This legislation contains significant liabilities restrict communications federal law enforcement release wanted undocumented criminals jails including known gang members repeat drunk drivers persons assault peace officers serial thieves abusers serious offenders. ” As know criminals — got Google The recidivism rate California 50 percent Over half people get released reoffend first year.Let talk couple recent examples What happened Northern California Oakland A law enforcement agency Merced County California arrested Mexican national robbery multiple weapons violations including carrying concealed weapon willful discharge firearm gross negligence This alien previously released local custody back community November 2017 following arrest conspiracy commit crime vandalism Despite fact issued detainer released.He one many public safety threats targeted recent operation Northern California ’ able locate.Since operation San Francisco Oakland three people ’ locate since reoffended The one person I talked arrested robbery multiple weapons violations.Another person arrested failed locate open area arrested third DUI Third DUI So ’ getting arrested three times many times committed crime That public safety threat He also convicted false imprisonment battery spouse But ’ locate latest operation Again released jail.And ’ third targeted criminal attempted arrest San Francisco area got rearrested corporeal injury spouse.There ’ two follow-up points I ’ like make First policies used criminal organizations Mexico Central America It ’ selling tactic get smuggled aliens sanctuary jurisdiction even local law enforcement ’ cooperate ICE thereby bankrolling criminal organizations smuggle aliens bankrolling criminal organizations killed Border Patrol agents special agents.Further sanctuary laws help employers exploit illicit — illegal workers low wages poor working conditions I want clear sanctuary policies ICE ’ asking local law enforcement ICE officers We ’ want making vehicle stops asking immigration questions.What want give federal law enforcement officers unfettered access county jail take custody somebody ’ country illegally yet commit another crime citizen country It ’ safer officers ’ safer community These people go reoffend communities live immigrant communities Sanctuary cities protect immigrant community They put harm ’ way.Thank Mr. President opportunity.THE PRESIDENT Thank Great job ’ done Tom Not

importance law enforcement poignantly sheriffs corrections And although large jail system embedded ICE agents jail people able slip cracks jails fortunate And spectacular failures every single day around California I ’ sure beyond folks ICE wants part priority — criminals going go known recidivism rate victimize folks — ’ unable capture apprehend keep detained deportation.I also unfortunate distinction one officers killed — Danny Oliver He also killed Detective Mike Davis adjacent Placer County shot third officer He ’ convicted faces death penalty But removed four times deported twice

leaders including Senator Tom Cotton Arkansas.It ’ important chief legal officer Arkansas ensure rule law upheld And sanctuary cities defying rule law They ’ putting citizens across United States risk

breed madness vast majority constituents —THE PRESIDENT It rather incredible.SENATOR TOOMEY — understand support.In fact sanctuary cities pro-immigrant communities pointed Legal immigrants country often live amongst people illegally lives threatened policy.It seems ’ two things need Mr. President And I ’ introduced legislation solves problem I think takes legislative solution comprehensively And legislation ensures municipality cooperating federal government would exposed legal liability Any legal liability belongs federal level legislation would clarify But municipality nevertheless
