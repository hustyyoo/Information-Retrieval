This unique country ’ got change.SECRETARY NIELSEN So framework proposed close So I remain hopeful work Congress behalf administration ’ behalf close loopholes secure borders communities.So without going detail I ’ like turn John Cronan ’ Acting Assistant Attorney General DOJ ’ Criminal Division He ’ going walk us bit MS-13.MR CRONAN Thank Secretary Nielsen.As know Mr. President stated one significant public safety threats communities face comes MS-13.MS-13 30,000 members worldwide But gang particularly massive troubling presence United States soil The numbers staggering An estimated 10,000 MS-13 members living country They ’ primarily composed immigrants descendants immigrants El Salvador infiltrated entire country.There MS-13 members 40 states District Columbia It estimated upwards 2,000 MS-13 members Los Angeles 800 1,200 Dallas Houston 2,000 Long Island 800 1,000 Boston 3,000 members right D.C. metropolitan area.And Mr. President said MS-13 probably ruthless violent gang terrorizing streets today One mottos “ Mata Viola Controla ” means “ Kill Rape Control. ” And Mr. President model MS-13 lives by.MS-13 members engage indiscriminate violence They commit rape extortion murder often sake They recruit children murderers They gang-rape young girls sell sex They attack victims chains bats machetes firearms There photo Mr. President shotgun machete recovered MS-13 members stopped police way murder student high school Woodbridge Virginia.In January last year Damaris Reyes Rivas 15 year-old girl suburb D.C. stabbed 13 times knives wooden stake MS-13 members Damaris ’ killers filmed murder could show leaders back El Salvador And Damaris ’ body barbarically dumped next railroad tracks run Beltway.Mr President know well story Kayla Cuevas Nisa Mickens two teenage girls best friends also savagely murder MS-13 thugs September 2016 You parents guests week ago State Union.A year September 2015 four MS-13 members Boston lured 15-year-old boy Constitution Beach East Boston took turns stabbing death The four murderers passed around two knives methodically ended life.The next photo Mr. President remains someone suspected rival gang member MS-13 members lured victim woods Central Islip Long Island beat sticks fire extinguisher cut throat pocketknife Once dead savages sadistically stuffed body drainage pipe went months without discovered.In October 2013 MS-13 members murdered someone believed snitch park Falls Church Virginia stabbing knives slashing machete And done buried body shallow grave park And months later park MS-13 members murdered recruit violated gang rules They severed head buried body well.That ’ first two shallow graves used bury two bodies second two graves Shallow graves used bury two bodies park 10 miles here.We let neighborhoods overrun violent crime And dismantling violent gangs specifically MS-13 top priority Department Justice.Like I said Mr. President MS-13 ’ motto “ Kill Rape Control. ” As Attorney General Jeff Sessions said Department Justice ’ motto “ Justice victims consequences criminals. ” And living motto.The Department Justice devoting resources necessary ensure citizens longer held hostage murderous savages like MS-13 members And working.Last year Department secured convictions 1,200 gang members We tried federal firearm prosecutions decade We brought cases violent criminals least quarter century And also enhancing capacity Northern Triangle countries — El Salvador Honduras Guatemala — combat MS-13 themselves.This past summer Attorney General Sessions visited El Salvador met El Salvadorian Attorney General Douglas Melendez discuss joint efforts dismantle MS-13 roots Soon meeting 700 gang members charged El Salvador.And Mr. President total work Central American partners resulted arrests charges 4,000 suspected MS-13 members And stop The Department Justice surging federal prosecutors hundreds federal prosecutors field specific directions focus violent crime immigration And continue use robust criminal statutes arrest violent criminals whatever crime commit — murder racketeering kidnapping drug trafficking — get streets.But Mr. President MS-13 based operates El Salvador MS-13 largely directs murderous mission prisons El Salvador enough enforce domestic violent crime laws gang members United States To effectively combat transnational organized crime also need enforcement immigration laws The reason MS-13 massive country reason 10,000 members 40 states District Columbia many gang members illegally entered country.Now Department Justice state authorities continue prosecute scores MS-13 members located United States But fail enforce immigration human smuggling laws loopholes immigration laws porous borders insufficient enforcement immigration laws MS-13 simply replenish jail population sending gang members across borders.And Department Justice Attorney General ’ leadership also focused stopping flow criminal aliens entering country The Attorney General directed prosecutors renew focus immigration offenses especially offenders nexus gangs drug cartels The Attorney General sent additional prosecutorial resources Southwest border created border security coordinators United States attorneys ’ offices They ’ tasked enforcing immigration laws special emphasis criminals like MS-13 nexus Southwest border.And lastly Mr. President smuggling front Department Justice working Department Homeland Security identify smuggling routes investigate prosecute MS-13 smuggling networks.Mr President Department Justice along Department Homeland Security federal state law enforcement partners committed taking lawful measures end scourge communities.THE PRESIDENT Thank John This actually removing thousands — prisons — literally thousands people removed But come back fast take Different ones — even ones — different ones But come back.And need immigration laws changed ’ going — ’ going able continue They come fast easy And catch-and-release You catch people release right away.Not another country world stupidity laws comes immigration And ’ get changed — ’ politics ’ Republican Democrat This common sense So taken care of.SECRETARY NIELSEN Sir ’ privilege introduce Angel Melendez ’ special agent charge ICE office New York City I want say I ’ extremely proud everything HSI office — But New York particular leads fight MS-13 truly day day put lives danger.REPRESENTATIVE KING He great job Terrific.THE PRESIDENT Good.SECRETARY NIELSEN So please Angel.MR MELENDEZ Mr. President good afternoon This quite privilege brief efforts And one things ’ important address ’ talking MS-13 war We ’ war — war countries command control It ’ issue ’ facing borders And goes beyond borders ’ war ’ battling streets local law enforcement partners.The important piece strategy addressing MS-13 collaboration intelligence sharing immigration enforcement Collaboration across spectrum across continuum countries Northern Triangle countries vetted teams foreign national law enforcement officials working side side HSI CBP countries.Locally thing We ’ able effectively implement unity effort within Department Homeland Security agencies components direct nexus immigration enforcement controlling borders working together face MS-13.One things look illicit pathways How get Who brings And ’ able see MS-13 organization smuggling apparatus So utilize organizations completely experts — complete experts — smuggling aspect.Last year able convict individual responsible smuggling network special interest aliens coming Pakistan Brazil Central America Mexico United States It ’ type illicit pathway MS-13 exploits And continue work foreign partners state local partners DHS partners able identify pathways.Capacity-building information-sharing extremely important — capacity-building Northern Triangle countries If take fight territory ’ less fight face here.But notwithstanding ’ address So came across border look curtail recruitment So look numbers — I ’ going talk numbers — posted website already Office Refugee Resettlement — 2017 alone — 2017 alone 40,810 unaccompanied alien children placed resettlement These ’ total amounts UACs detained border These ones referred resettled within United States.When look demographics turns 21,881 Northern Triangle countries right age gang recruitment ages 13 17 males I saying — I want clear — 21,000 unaccompanied alien children gang members What I ’ saying understanding MS-13 ’ looking 21,000 unaccompanied alien children came states potential recruits continue fill ranks.Another aspect — another thing ’ able look across certain operations ’ able manage throughout last couple years 30 percent consistent number ’ seen MS-13 members arrested came country unaccompanied alien children.Specifically New York another point interest ’ addressing ’ looking Special Immigrant Juvenile program Sixty-three percent unaccompanied alien children filed immigration status provides road green card lawful permanent resident eventually even citizenship.The way works basically state court provides order — special cause — alien able apply CIS status Now one things ’ seen ’ know ’ family court records So utilize information provided proceedings validate information either encounter border process local office.Finances Finance another important aspect MS-13 We ’ able identify complex integral scheme way move money And ’ — way shape form talking money — cartel-type money We ’ talking money utilize able finance movements day-to-day operations money ’ coming states back command control Northern Triangle.One important tools arsenal designation MS-13 transnational criminal organization Department Justice — Department Treasury I may correct myself.I — I say — I numerous pages talking points things I talk I want give Mr. President perspective field When agents going identifying based intelligence conducting targeted enforcement operations apprehend individuals ’ able determine MS-13 members And presented immigration judge detention purposes explain individuals threat society MS-13 members But provide information many instances information part ongoing criminal investigation.These individuals released utilize resources focus individuals released.So perspective field many things could accomplished within immigration law But I tell perspective I ’ seeing day-to-day basis agents going agents arresting individuals arrested released again.Through efforts since 2005 ICE arrested 7,000 MS-13 members In quarter last quarter 2018 ’ able arrest 428 MS-13 members And talks numbers So know understand based intelligence gathered thousands MS-13 across country There even Northern Triangle Mexico We ’ seen presence country north us Canada well.The fact matter continue arrest continue arrest since ’ able shut pipeline continue come country And something need address effective disrupting dismantling MS-13.Thank sir.THE PRESIDENT We need cooperation Democrats know Because change rules change laws ’ part ’ trying get approved Because right — way right ’ Everything illegal You ’ touch ’ anything And ’ get laws changed better anybody still never satisfactory.SECRETARY NIELSEN Thank Thank I ’ like ask Jessie Liu U.S. Attorney District Columbia give us examples cases ’ worked.MS LIU Well thank much Secretary Nielsen And thank Mr. President inviting talk MS-13 ’ combat Washington D.C.As U.S. Attorney District Columbia top priority safety people live work means protecting vicious criminal gangs like MS-13.So recent years working law enforcement partners ’ successfully prosecuted number MS-13 leaders members murder maiming racketeering crimes And number individuals serving prison sentences life even beyond.In one case woman D.C. took MS-13 gang member home country El Salvador allowed live family The gang member began recruiting woman ’ son join MS-13 And objected gang member shot head waiting bus stop three miles ’ sitting right shot head lying ground pool blood Miraculously Mr. President survived permanently blinded attack.In another case office handled MS-13 members repeatedly stabbed killed 14-year-old boy near Columbia Heights metro station ’ two half miles ’ sitting right now.In yet another case MS-13 members attacked fellow MS-13 member removed gang tattoos They stabbed least 20 times killed him.We believe prosecutions took many years build helped disrupt MS-13 District Columbia But know continues operate city well next door Virginia Maryland And ’ particularly concerned international reach including violence drug dealing efforts recruit young people.That ’ work every day closely fantastic law enforcement partners ICE FBI Metropolitan Police Department agencies well strong allies community work dissuade young people joining gangs like MS-13.Mr President ’ grateful support ’ given efforts close partnership Secretary team guidance resources colleagues Main Justice like Mr. Cronan And I thank opportunity brief today.THE PRESIDENT Thank Jessie much Great job.MS LIU Thank much.SECRETARY NIELSEN Thank I ’ like turn Director Cissna ’ hearing lot work revise immigration system He ’ going talk little bit backlog exacerbates problem.MR CISSNA So Mr. President ’ — outset remarks talked four pillars immigration reform administration advancing right getting rid chain migration getting rid visa lottery border security sort DACA fix.This issue gangs attaches different way I think border security obviously If border secure ’ question border integrity integrity immigration laws Agent Melendez described people coming border ’ secure harms public safety interior well It ’ connected.With respect three immigration program little selectivity going potentially allow mala fide actors come country ’ watchful law help us.I would say one thing I want amplify something Secretary said talked loopholes ’ also struggling priorities ’ advancing The loophole talked grounds law right permit us deport gang member merely ’ gang member We wait ’ actually killed somebody harmed American Then reason deport get Or ’ unlawfully okay But ’ lawfully ’ gang member ’ ground removal really.Similarly ’ ground inadmissibility So ’ stop coming people may grant immigration pathway ’ — nothing law makes gang member merely ’ gang member ineligible benefit.Indeed might even get citizenship law right You ’ called good moral character become citizen But gang membership explicitly list things makes qualified good moral character.We take account look weigh gang membership things life required deny citizenship.This untenable I urge members Congress sitting today help us fix That horrendous loophole It affects public safety affects integrity laws It stand That ’ all.THE PRESIDENT Thank much Thanks Francis.SECRETARY NIELSEN Thank If could turn sheriff Loudoun County If could give us perspective field would great.SHERIFF CHAPMAN Thank Mr. President I ’ Mike Chapman I ’ sheriff Loudoun County I ’ honored And represent probably one fastest-growing wealthiest counties nation Even Forbes magazine I think said one happiest counties nation.And despite still

school bus And another victim stabbed 17 times He jumped gang members stabbed 17 times.So ’ real problem concerned enforcement-wise And also full-service sheriff ’ office also handle jails So make
