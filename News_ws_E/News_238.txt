EDTMS SANDERS Pulling big guns Friday Laughter Serious business Good afternoon.Q Good afternoon Happy Friday.MS SANDERS Let start addressing Black Hawk helicopter crash Iraq At least initial reporting crash appear caused enemy action However incident investigation This tragic crash reminds us courageous men women take extraordinary risks every single day service country.American troops alongside coalition partners continue efforts defeat ISIS Iraq Syria prevent re-emergence As President tweeted “ Our thoughts prayers go families loved ones brave troops lost… Their sacrifice service country never forgotten. ” Looking ahead next week President traveling New Hampshire Monday The purpose trip enforce administration ’ commitment combatting opioid crisis.As President said State Union Address “ administration committed fighting drug epidemic helping get treatment need hurt terribly The struggle long difficult Americans always — end succeed We prevail. ” As know last couple weeks highlighted Democrats ’ unprecedented effort stop President filling administration highly-qualified nominees.Today special guest us provide additional details front Marc Short Director Legislative Affairs come make statement take questions Then I ’ back ’ done take questions news day Thanks.Marc.MR SHORT Thanks Sarah Hey good afternoon Since I know many interested White House personnel issues wanted take minutes discuss historic obstruction faced Senator Schumer Senate Democrats confirming nominees enable us fill White House.The Senate obviously constitutional responsibility advice consent So looks like real life President selects nominee undergo entire FBI background check work Office Government Ethics de-conflict financial issues — ’ process takes good amount time good amount resources.Only cleared FBI background check Office Government Ethics nominee submitted United States Senate When get Senate go several additional evaluations including meetings staff meetings members sides aisle The nominee undergoes hearing committee votes nominee get committee.At point nominee moves Senate floor full confirmation Traditionally Senate routinely confirms administration ’ nominees committee It respect American people election administration fill roles new President Instead Senator Schumer done require cloture votes essentially slow process obstruct.At point past four administrations combined — last four administrations — Senate conducted 17 cloture votes combined cloture vote essence filibuster nominee Seventeen cloture votes last four administrations combined point Today Senate 79 cloture votes first 14 months administration Seventeen last four administrations versus seventy-nine first 14 months administration That roughly five times number last four administrations combined.Senator Schumer essentially weaponizing Senate procedure demanding cloture votes nominees even eventually supports Eleven President ’ nominees approved without single dissenting vote yet still forced go 30-hours debate essentially slow Senate calendar simply purpose obstruction Even Senate Democrats begun call say getting point ridiculous.At rate United States Senate would take eleven half years confirm nominees Eleven half years confirm nominees.So let give one example comparison historically In first entire term George H.W Bush administration entire four years faced one cloture vote In entire four years Clinton administration faces 10 cloture votes Under George W. Bush administration entire first term faced four cloture votes Barack Obama faced 17 first entire four years We faced 79 first 14 months That adds 32 combined entire first four years administrations relative 79 first less year half.So let give couple illustrations specific individuals Pat Pizzella nominee Deputy Secretary Department Labor We still Deputy Secretary number two person Department Labor Pat Pizzella nominated 269 days ago He reported committee October He confirmed George W. Bush administration unanimous voice vote So ’ already confirmed previous Congress without dissention yet 269 days later still Deputy Secretary Department Labor.At EPA Deputy Administrator Andrew Wheeler nominated 152 days ago Scott Pruitt still day deputy number two serving EPA He reported committee November.Yleem Poblete Assistant Secretary Arms Control Department State confirmed Obviously Arms Control important issue national security particularly heightened light upcoming negotiations North Korea She nominated 298 days ago previously Staff Director House Foreign Affairs Committee.Isabel Patelunas nominated 270 days ago reported committee July nominated Assistant Secretary Treasury Intelligence Analysis This helps work many sanctions covered.So many positions fact national security positions And lastly Kevin McAleenan Commissioner Customs Border Patrol nominated 298 days ago Obviously ’ priority administration highlight security threats face southern border Kevin taking role safeguarding borders helping prevent terrorists contraband entering United States Yet Congress Senate continues dither confirmation vote.We pleased finally got cloture vote last week We expect confirmed Monday night But 298 days later — American people anxious make sure south border secured still head Customs Border Patrol.So level obstruction beyond historic It something — I know focused personnel inside White House — ask also shed light historic obstruction ’ happening United States Senate make sure able fill administration job American people help make sure country safe secure.Q Thanks lot Marc Thanks coming You mentioned plight nominee State Department Arms Control position mentioned need person upcoming negotiations North Korea yet still nominee U.S Ambassador South Korea Why When nominee And position also important efforts MR SHORT Sure I think several conversations internally putting forward nominees — go process In many cases gets delayed long nominees withdrawn process actually submitted Senate So couple examples ’ happened recently That includes post But ongoing conversations nominating someone soon.Q On Rick Grenell President ’ nominee Ambassador Germany Senator actually holding nomination withholding unanimous consent And ’ Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell — reason given withholding unanimous consent ’ Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell force vote nominee.MR SHORT Thanks I ’ going — Mary Elizabeth one stars team ’ us day one helped staff Justice Gorsuch confirmation helped us shepherd one charge nominations So I ’ going phone friend one Grenell got committee right And basically ’ waiting final vote Senate floor.MS TAYLOR Yes.MR SHORT And I believe got committee several months back So ’ another one list waiting.The challenge Leader McConnell faces — ’ allowed bring voice vote go cloture prioritize And one nominees simply historically obstructed.Yeah.Q Marc thanks You know well goes Hill This part toxic nature ’ going several years I mean Democrats pushing back Republicans What ease water toxicity What And secondly explain ’ understand minority party — control Congress — know House Senate — ’ unable get one big stumbling blocks people understand ’ complaining.MR SHORT Right Well I think reality Senate process ’ House process But nominate candidate Senate personnel issue Senate ability go nomination process — committee process — requires super majority get past motion proceed And Senate done ’ basically said ’ going require cloture vote nominees historically committee would bring Senate floor would require up-or-down vote.And say part toxicity going time I think ’ point ’ trying make ’ going time This tradition United States Senate ’ right Senator Schumer It — happened As numbers I went faced four times number cloture votes 14 months last four terms combined — last 16 years first term Presidency So ’ historically done.Q Do see reflection example Obama office Republicans said going make prime concern pass legislation Obama favored Don ’ ’ see part problem MR SHORT I think part challenge American people got frustrated way Washington worked elected outsider come Washington try help fix What ’ trying shed light way town works way currently United States Senate broken.And yes assigning blame Senator Schumer team Democrats many cases even fellow Democrats saying level getting absurd ’ time allow President fill administration.Q And Republicans ’ bear blame MR SHORT I think reality Republicans moving forward votes I think far one solutions going obviously issue United States Senate But I think force pressure continue see rules changed United States Senate.Q But specifically Marc President still feel — still feel — feel Rule 22 amended eliminated prevent ’ describing national security ramifications I mean number positions arguing essential national security United States And say something Democrats obstructing Republicans 51 votes What happen MR SHORT I think United States Senate going continue internal conversations potential rule changes I think ’ fair question I want respectful White House determine United States Senate rules But I think continuing highlight recognize level obstruction I think continues put pressure Senate address internally.Q Oh well I going ask ’ concerned objection carry nominee Secretary State nominee CIA Director MR SHORT Thanks I think obviously current Director CIA somebody incredibly qualified As people know graduated top class West Point graduated top class Harvard Law School I think ’ done phenomenal job Director CIA went process earned bipartisan support Director CIA.So would certainly hope considering 14 months ago 15 Senate Democrats crossed support nomination — would also support nomination Secretary State.Likewise feel Gina uniquely qualified — somebody served CIA 33 years Station Chief multiple localities commended Democrats Republicans alike served previous administrations I think incredible qualities.We ’ excited nomination We ’ excited would first female Director CIA And would expect quick — would expect quick hearing moving forward vote critical national security positions.Q Marc President personal conversations Senator Schumer “ obstruction ” words — specifically ’ conversations infrastructure matters Has Senate Democrats And ’ heard talking And also believe given backlog many confirmation hearings Senate withstand leads potential personnel announcements may may seeing coming days MR SHORT I think ’ going — I think President vocal I think perhaps I ’ warmup act making larger foray make case American people objection gotten ridiculous And yes ’ also spoken Senator Schumer frustration it.Q Marc possibility President could offer something — make deal everyone gets want But offered anything Senator Schumer exchange helping get nominations MR SHORT I guess ’ hard understand offering American people elect President — elect new administration come — expectation able fill administration.The Senate advise-and-consent role offering making deal something normal process United States Senate For us would kind hard understand.Q I mean conversations DACA suggestion — know would make concessions DACA help get nominations MR SHORT Well I think DACA President clear wants make deal I think put forward rational proposal One even provided pathway citizenship 1.8 million people I think ’ frustrated far Democrats ’ seem actually want come table want politicize issue.We stand ready make deal But I reject notion something offered job They job American people I ’ something barter order ’ supposed do.Q On DACA room smaller deal Are working smaller deal — one ’ four pillars might part omnibus MR SHORT As I said President open continuing negations He ’ anxious get deal He believes ’ important secure border also believes passionately people country working productively order get DACA permit obeying law So wants protect We ’ anxious find way get deal.Q That ’ yes Marc MR SHORT Inaudible Please.Q Thanks Just clear Marc challenges getting personnel cleared U.S. Congress prevent President changing makeup Cabinet right wanted MR SHORT No I think — I ’ — I believe President always ability make changes wants I ’ think — ’ ready make change ’ I ’ sure ’ worried process is.But I think challenge — requirement put forward quality people And look Gina Director Pompeo ’ incredibly qualified We think ’ make enormous contributions administration American people And certainly hope United States Senate confirm quickly.MR SHORT Thank all.Q Thanks
