Remarks CEA Chairman Kevin Hassett New York Federal Reserve Bank Remarks Economy Jobs Issued April 23 2018 Council Economic AdvisersAs prepared delivery Kevin Hassett April 23 2018.It pleasure New York today speak topic situating Administration policy broader economic context U.S. abroad And honor presence many distinguished economists policymakers.Looking crowd I see many friends I ’ known years And I help reminded first projects I worked economist exploring effects policy changes economy Being takes back time really years ago—a years take logarithm raw data per econometric conventions economics profession.The econometric issue question focus mine graduate school faculty member Columbia It issue generate causal estimates effect policy changes The intuition issue—one CEA Chair I confirm true—is policy changes random Policymakers formulate policy response current expected economic conditions Looking correlations policy variables trajectory economic conditions would lead spurious estimates policy influences economic conditions A correlation causal estimate make Moreover direction bias tend non-random Policies intended reverse mitigate bad economic conditions would appear cause deteriorations economic conditions Think like Visits doctor would appear based perusal raw data treatments outcomes cause downturn one ’ health.I remember first regression space graduate school revealed investment tax credits cause steep reductions investment Puzzling wrong-signed result rapidly became clear ITC ’ U.S. almost always recessions A large academic literature found user cost elasticity investment essentially zero But policymakers tended enact investment tax credits response current expected downturns economic conditions Was endogeneity policy driving result Indeed Alan Auerbach I showed one first publications Alan Auerbach I exploited fact user cost capital varies cross-sectionally tax reduction variation surely inadvertent Looking 1986 tax reform Alan I used exogenous variation generate robust test predictions neoclassical model We found elasticity zero correct sign might even north unity The endogeneity policy unaccounted previous literature explained apparent ineffectiveness policy.Only log years later inference tax policy influences behavior seems stood test time The capacity economic research identify causal effects variation policy also grown The literature ’ arc towards larger rather smaller estimates effects policy variables around us top journals Consider instance emergence called “ narrative approach ” identifying effects tax policy economic activity These methodologies harness advances computational power natural language processing identify stated motivations policymakers Alan I worried log years ago While single paper dispositive consider February 2018 online issue Quarterly Journal Economics features article draws narrative approach estimate elasticity personal income respect marginal tax rates The paper ’ headline estimates north 1 1.2 exact —very high contemporary standards well literature log years ago.But identification causal effects econometric estimates require assumptions structure functional form relationships specified set policy variables measures economic activity That addition requirement course relevant data hand first place—a requirement typically satisfied hindsight But value knowing whether policy working intended The observation variation forecasts policy changed offers one way looking policy ’ likely effects Alan I first paper And economists wait evaluations effect Tax Cuts Jobs Act economic growth percolate peer-review process academic journals looking changes growth forecasts TCJA offers one way gauge expected effect growth.The evolution recent forecast revisions quite revealing consistent tax act large effect growth expectations If one looks example Blue Chip consensus forecast four-quarter real GDP growth 2018 2019 roughly flat throughout 2017 media coverage legislative prospects Administration ’ economic agenda generally pessimistic Consensus forecasts November 2017 therefore low—2.3 2.4 percent 2018 2.1 percent 2019.Since November however ’ seen steady upward revisions private forecasts As month Blue Chip consensus forecast 2018 growth 2.8 percent 2019 growth 2.3 percent upward revisions 0.5 0.2 percentage point since tax act passed Official forecasts revisions suggest even bigger bump In last forecast tax bill passed Congressional Budget Office projected growth 2.0 1.5 percent 2018 2019 That revised substantially—to 3.3 2.4 percent respectively In words CBO projects growth percentage point higher average next two years year ago In addition timeframe CBO revised forecast projected corporate income tax receipts 2018-2027 period 476 billion Which exceeds CBO ’ 409 billion static score TCJA Ex ante knowing TCJA passed based paper corporate tax rates Laffer curve Alex Brill one could predicted revenue increase.Meanwhile last summer tax debate got seriously underway Federal Open Market Committee median forecast growth 2.1 1.9 percent 2018 2019 That since revised 0.6 0.5 percentage point respectively upward revision occurring December tax bill made legislative finish line.Last week International Monetary Fund released April 2018 World Economic Outlook WEO Global growth 2018 revised 0.2 percentage point October WEO release 3.9 percent year-over-year The IMF attributes roughly half global growth revision changes U.S. fiscal policy When honing United States IMF ’ April 2018 update October 2017 World Economic Outlook revised growth forecast 0.6 percentage point October 2.9 percent year-over-year According IMF one reason upward revision macroeconomic effects stemming Tax Cuts Jobs Act passed December.The IMF ’ April upwards revision October global growth forecast wake passage TCJA follows OECD ’ March upwards revision November global growth forecast For U.S. 2018 outlook increased 0.4 percentage point 2.9 percent 2019 outlook increased 0.7 percentage point 2.8 percent And OECD ’ March Economic Outlook cited one “ key factors behind upward revision global growth prospects 2018 2019 ” “ tax reductions announced last three months. ” I note passing revisions almost exactly analysis last year implied would bill passes.As global growth CEA ’ in-house analysis finds exogenous tax changes world ’ largest economy large effects global growth suggesting recent rise growth expectations around world result fiscal developments United States way around Applying Romer Romer exogenous tax shock series global structural vector autoregressive model indicates 1 percent cut U.S. taxes fraction GDP raises growth European Union 0.8 percent year immediately following peak impact 1.2 percent 2 years We reject null hypothesis effect 95 percent confidence The estimated effect rest world even bigger peak impact 2 years 2.1 percent actually reject null 95 percent years 1 2.While mechanisms relating exogenous U.S. tax changes global growth remain open I believe fascinating question ongoing work magnitude effect strongly suggests extend far beyond arithmetic relationship implied U.S. share global GDP Our intuition countries often learn U.S. success adopt similar policies Policy endogenous successful policies copied.These forecasts revised eye toward literature rejects user cost elasticity zero But ’ believe forecasts You already see effects emerging data Real private nonresidential fixed investment increased 6.3 percent fourth quarter 2017 according data Bureau Economic Analysis Equipment investment rose 8.9 percent thanks largely tax law ’ allowance full expensing equipment investment retroactively September 2017 In March 2018 Morgan Stanley Composite Capital Expenditure Plans Index reached highest level since began tracking 2006 The three-month moving average 34 percent since November 2017 last month bill became law Goldman Sachs ’ capex tracker similarly cycle high.When literature settles I sure discover many patterns data expect But investment boom continues expected I think agree mark important historic moment success economics science guides policy
