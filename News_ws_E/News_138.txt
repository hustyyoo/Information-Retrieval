April 27th The President looks forward celebrating incredible athletes remarkable achievements 2018 Winter Games.Before taking questions today I special guest us Secretary Nielsen Department Homeland Security.As know President received briefing yesterday administration ’ strategy confront growing threat illegal immigration drugs violent gang members coming across southern border.As President said mobilization National Guard important part strategy Secretary Nielsen come deliver brief remarks take questions.And I ’ back answer questions day topics With Secretary.SECRETARY NIELSEN Well good afternoon everyone I want start — I ’ going give facts perspective Hopefully I put things context.But I want start simple statement today ’ announcement Border security homeland security national security It ’ partisan issue It ’ something separate It ’ core sovereign nation.The President reiterated many times In fact specifically said sovereign nation worse chooses defend borders soon cease fact sovereign nation.The threat real We talked last 18 months The Department Homeland Security since creation 2003 watched current emerging threats Despite number steps administration taken I ’ talk shortly continue see unacceptable levels illegal drugs dangerous gang activity transnational criminal organizations illegal immigration flow across border This threatens safety communities children also rule law know country founded It ’ time act.So let ’ talk little bit today In effort prevent consequence President directed Department Defense Department Homeland Security work together governors deploy National Guard southwest border assist Border Patrol The President signing proclamation effect today.When President took office last year issued series executive orders directives empowered DHS first time almost decade fully enforce border security immigration laws At time saw precipitous drop unlawful border crossings — 44 percent first months inauguration.This “ Trump effect ” many referred well illicit border activity undeniable smugglers transnational criminal organizations responsible illicit activity across border forced wait see enhanced enforcement efforts would scale back criminal activity good.In last 15 months President ’ leadership administration taken major steps methodically strengthen border security Let give ’ happy provide additional details.We stepped targeting dangerous criminal gangs MS-13 We removed thousands criminal aliens year prior We longer exempt entire classes illegal aliens consequences breaking immigration laws We began first new border wall system construction close decade We modified asylum system processing quickly adjudicate claims And ended so-called “ temporary immigration programs ” either constitutionally dubious administered manner inconsistent purpose law contrary intent Congress.Despite actions ’ recently seen numbers illegal border crossings rise 40-year lows last April back previous levels Our current border security immigration laws fail American people The system rewards bad behavior It punish lawbreakers It undermines nation ’ economic interest Make mistake interdiction without ability promptly remove without legitimate cause border security It national security.When President took office traffickers smugglers TCOs illegal aliens serve currency paused see border enforcement efforts would look like could follow deportation removal While apprehending aliens border historic efficiency illicit smuggling groups saw ability actually remove come illegally keep pace They saw loopholes could exploit avoid detention removal And let give numbers put changed context immigration border security system.Before 2013 approximately one every 100 arriving aliens claimed credible fear first step United States asylum process Today one 10 Why matters number unfortunately demonstrates indicative rising level fraud plagues system This prevents us timely helping really need asylum When deal fraud backlogs unable help truly need.Before 2011 90 percent arriving aliens single adult males Today 40 percent families children The traffickers smugglers know arrive family current legal court system much better chance released United States We seen smugglers advertise enticement seen traffickers unfortunately fraudulently use children gain entry country.Before 2009 — last stat — 90 percent arriving aliens Mexican nationals Today nearly 50 percent Central America The traffickers smugglers know individuals U.S. law easily removed expeditious way back country origin exploit loophole.Each reflect effects legislative legal loopholes made much difficult remove bulk apprehend whether criminals traffickers gangs illegal aliens.Those falsely claiming asylum know use magic words “ credible fear ” low threshold currently exists large backlog released work permits interior many years see judge.In 2012 DACA offered families children similarly understood deferred action table possibility future deferred action caused additional migration continues today This exacerbated deeply flawed Flores Settlement Agreement one talked And inability use expedited removal authority unaccompanied alien children.Because see many Central American families children attempting enter country illegally many decade ago.Smugglers gaming system pure simple They take advantage loopholes laws They know prosecute need stop behavior And know cases takes many years removed This addition creates massive magnet additional illegal immigration TCO activity criminal activity across border.Every day rely number partnerships help us accomplish mission secure borders State local officials interagency federal partners Congress course international partners I continue work partners This problem requires attention.This administration also asked Congress help Congress makes immigration law It ’ simple That system works Congress makes immigration law Congress decides classes aliens allowed country deported We ’ asked changes existing law close loopholes exacerbate challenges often result de facto court order resource constrained resulting catch-and-release.The President know terminated administrative catch-and-release last year due loopholes often find particularly family must released 20 days.We asked Congress additional funds border wall system detention beds personnel magnet lawlessness still draws people thousands borders Why attempt journey belief ’ ever caught We must change environment We must change reduce pull factors.Unfortunately time time Congress failed act Worse still members Congress continually opposed efforts secure border As result continued congressional inaction administration drafted legislation asking Congress provide legal authority resources address crisis borders.We allow illegal immigration levels become norm — thousand people day 300,000 year Violating sovereignty nation never acceptable President.Since becoming Secretary I ’ spoken hundreds members Congress need legislation I continue speak anyone listen need end catch-and-release close loopholes all.Based conversations congressional leadership I optimistic We country based rule law I ask Congress pass needed legislation urgency I work Let ’ get done.In meantime President directed National Guard personnel deployed southern border The Department Defense know long supported efforts DHS protect nation ’ borders This includes ongoing counternarcotic missions infrastructure construction persistent surveillance operations training aerial support throughout Western Hemisphere The Department Defense longtime partner Department Homeland Security I thank support.While plans finalized ’ expectation National Guard deploy personnel support CBP ’ border security mission It take

partnership expect operation affect relationship.I want close saying problems catch-and-release unsecured borders solvable problems Congress ability opportunity provide administration country tools needs border security In conversations members Congress said border security rule law.The vulnerabilities need address well known The legislative fixes drafted debated The tools tested ready All lacking act I ’ hoping changes I call members Congress work us close loopholes end catch-and-release completely.Let clear welcoming nation We support tens millions legal visitors every year well 1 million legal immigrants We continue But I said earlier border security national security Security nation partisan issue Border security national security.It ’ foundational element security systems citizens homeland The President committed securing border using tools available I thank leadership support DHS.I thank listening I look forward questions.Q Maybe context could compare President

submitted specific plan Congress — need wall type wall need We ’ finished evaluating prototypes We toolkit Some parts border different In one place even wall almost floats sand conditions And places
