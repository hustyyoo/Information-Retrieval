place prior part President ’ campaign.Q Let ask Syria I think last summer — Sean Spicer podium issued statement said “ Assad conducts another mass murder attack using chemical weapons military pay heavy price. ” Given developments Syria ’ seen last days Assad regime notice And President Trump talked President Putin recent days situation MS SANDERS I think President put Assad regime notice time ago ’ continuing echo message When I said call immediate end offensive operations mean But terms specific action ’ said I ’ going broadcast may may But I think absolutely take seriously.Is second

checks 2013 — idea expanding existing background check system also cover private sales gun shows Internet Is something least ’ open — looking MS SANDERS I ’ aware ’ know position ’ right I know supports Cornyn legislation would something administration could get behind.In terms specific pieces legislation STOP Guns Violence Act would another piece legislation President would specifically support Any legislation beyond ’ see looks like review make determination.Q Has ruled Has ruled looking —MS SANDERS I ’ asked specifically.Q And one thing The First Lady today remarks — brief remarks governors — spouses I guess — mentioned young students Stoneman Douglas advocating past couple weeks — praised said voices need heard Given large majority students expressing views run counter policies administration things administration would support — example assault weapons bans — President also agree First Lady important voices need heard MS SANDERS Absolutely And ’ reason number White

Jim.Q When President said earlier today would run school suggesting could saved day Parkland What —MS SANDERS I think stating leader would stepped hopefully able help number individuals school — coach adults even lot students — stepped helped protect students I think point making would wanted played role well.Q Can I follow Is trained firing weapon Is trained using handgun firearm sort MS SANDERS I ’ think point making He saying would leader would want take courageous action And lot individuals helped protect others day ’ carrying firearms I think shows helpful process without it.Q There lot parents worried lot people inside schools weapons could turn situation like Wild West What would say parents worried faculty members coaches administrators packing heat school MS SANDERS That ’ ’ conversation There also lot parents And heard one whose daughter tragically murdered last week — one parents Parkland advocated personnel guns So ’ lot different people sides issue.That ’ ’ continuing
