Taoiseach I ’ many times I ’ also various parts United States St. Patrick ’ Day It ’ tradition government St. Patrick ’ Day unique national day ’ celebrated world dispatch cabinet members across world represent us St. Patrick ’ Day.And I pleasure couple years ago sent Miami Atlanta Savannah wonderful St. Patrick ’ Day trip And I parade Savannah I ’ sure ’ amazing It I think one best parades world I think ’ biggest one New York actually one I ’ Saturday And Savannah beautiful city really put great party.So extend stay days — laughter — I think I ’ sure ’ impossible given schedule.I know know 35 million people America claim Irish ancestry I think ’ St. Patrick ’ Day big day side Atlantic That 35 million includes lots people live work right nation ’ capital wonderful reminders yesterday White House Capitol Hill also ambassador ’ St. Patrick ’ Day reception truly remarkable day.It also real pleasure yesterday today make acquaintance members family including course mother And talking yesterday White House I believe father born Ireland ’ right So ’ — ’ real genuine close connection I think family We lot work find Obama ’ Moneygall much work find Irish connection Vice President Pence.This year well know Bliain na Gaeilge ’ year ’ celebrating Irish language native language And I learned yesterday — I ’ know I surprised I ’ know — President Trump ’ mother Scottish spoke Scots Gaelic And Scots Gaelic similar Irish language Gaeilge You actually understand So fascinating thing know thing learn.But I told — least people research behalf tell child Vice President could recite nursery rhyme “ Humpty Dumpty ” Irish learned grandfather So sure ’ true — laughter — I ’ embarrass asking.THE VICE PRESIDENT Don ’ test Laughter PRIME MINISTER VARADKAR I ’ embarrass asking much remember I ’ pretty sure I ’ know English Laughter But story Vice President mentioned goes back Vice President ’ grandfather Richard Michael Cawley remarkable man left Doocastle County Mayo county line Tubbercurry County Sligo mother faith would find new future here.And I saying Vice President earlier ’ border Sligo Mayo ’ always better choose Mayo county ’ much better football Laughter You ’ much likely win.But accounts patriot proud man man built new life Chicago raised children love Ireland United States And I think mother ’ dream fulfilled success course family.And I know ’ spoken visits Ireland young man bringing Karen children Ireland well I ’ also told visits cousin ’ bar Doonbeg course direct competition boss ’ slightly larger establishment across street Laughter But proud say American Dream much still realized.Ireland know really unique relationship America It goes back centuries even founding great Republic struggle Irish men Irish women played securing American independence helping build America Irish hands signed Declaration Independence Irish arms helped make reality We helped create Republic many ways ’ helped us rebuild country particularly recent years.And give one powerful example many know year marks 20th anniversary Good Friday Agreement pivotal moment Irish history And agreement approved people Ireland North South owed much support United States able guidance Senator George Mitchell And ’ still guided many ways people take interest Irish affairs administration also Hill.The agreement stood test time There bumps road — serious always — United States always side.While Northern Island free serious violence two decades still divided place politically It ’ cold peace many ways And moment power-sharing Executive cross-community Assembly ’ met year So important sooner rather later Northern Ireland governed politicians live elected people And I certainly hope possible restore institutions months ahead And I know count country continue historic role supporter Ireland peace process.The United States Ireland also enjoy strong exceptional economic relationship delivering jobs prosperity countries As I mentioned speeches meetings past couple weeks — past couple days rather It ’ seem like weeks yet Laughter But seem like long time But I said meetings speeches 100,000 Americans 50 states working Irish-owned companies particularly food sector tech also construction About 2 billion worth trade across Atlantic directions every week.And I think ’ clear mutual interests sustain level trade investment ’ need grow years ahead And ’ I ’ supportive free-trade agreement EU including Ireland one hand United States grow — jobs investment trade going directions balanced fair way.One meaningful Irish proverbs “ Ní neart go cur le chéile. ” And roughly translates “ There ’ strength unless ’ together. ” And I think ’ true point history.The Atlantic long barrier Europe North America byword important economic political relationship world It ’ transatlantic alliance helped shaped helped keep global order 75 years one I think need protect So let ’ look forward work towards ever-stronger relationship United States Europe Ireland.And let finish thanking hospitality delegation We would really delighted return hospitality return visit Ireland next I really look forward that.Lá fhéile Pádraig sona dhuit Happy St. Patrick ’ Day everyone Thank Applause END
