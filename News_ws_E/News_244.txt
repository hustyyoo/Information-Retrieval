giving Irene survivors audience round applause.We gathered together afternoon holy ground This museum bears witness horrific acts evil atrocity ever inflicted humanity.The documents recordings mementos contained walls provide testimony behalf millions Holocaust victims unjustly taken us could share stories.Standing beautiful Hall Remembrance Museum still feel weight every human life lost.Engraved wall behind eternal flame well-known passage Deuteronomy “ Guard guard soul carefully lest forget things eyes saw … shall make known children children ’ children. ” The United States Holocaust Museum teaches importance remembrance.This Museum tells stories beloved children like seven-year-old Tommy Pfeffer gassed death Auschwitz alongside ten-year-old brother Jan-Peter.It tells stories righteous—rescuers risked lives save others like Raoul Wallenberg Oskar Schindler.And tells stories inspiring Jewish resistance fighters like young Hannah Senesh parachuted behind enemy lines British Army aid anti-Nazi partisans rescue Jews.As many know Hannah captured occupied Hungary interrogated tortured During almost five months prison Hannah revealed information mission.Eventually convicted treason sentenced death On November 7 1944 twenty-three years age Hannah taken Budapest courtyard refused blindfold.A poem found Hannah ’ cell execution read part “ I gambled mattered most. ” It important remember happened people like Hannah Tommy Irene know horrors happen again.But remembrance first step stop remembrance alone.If fulfill promise “ Never Again ” must also act protect victims hold responsible parties accountable.Unfortunately today Syria confronted worst atrocities known man.This war raged seven years.The Assad regime killed indiscriminately tortured starved raped used chemical weapons people It attacked hospitals schools countless Syrians arrested abducted simply disappeared.And ISIS kidnapped tortured murdered brutally persecuted religious minorities committed unspeakable horrors burning victims alive cages.The Syria exhibit Holocaust Museum I visited January details horrifying crimes photographs film first-person accounts documentary evidence.It estimated nearly 500,000 people perished since war began In February alone nearly 1,400 civilians died The conflict created 5 million refugees 6 million displaced persons.Today I want tell United States taking action protect innocent Syrians defeat ISIS hold Assad regime sponsors accountable crimes.First like many room today documenting atrocities.The United States declassifying intelligence exposes Assad ’ horrific crimes.In May last year President Trump released images believe depict crematorium one regime ’ prisons likely installed hide evidence mass murder.Our administration also helping fund International Impartial Independent Mechanism Triple I-M created United Nations General Assembly.Triple I-M ’ mission collect analyze evidence international humanitarian law human rights violations Syria prepare evidence independent criminal proceedings.We also proud support United Nations Independent International Commission Inquiry Syrian Arab Republic.This independent impartial commission documents serious human rights abuses committed parties conflict.Second fighting alongside partners Syrian Democratic Forces defeat terrorist organizations.The Coalition Defeat ISIS liberated almost 100 percent territory previously held terrorists Iraq Syria.We made immense progress alongside allies partners past year work do.The United States continue pursue murderers ISIS completely defeated population centers stabilized refugees safely return home.Third providing humanitarian aid people need most—the victims.The United States provided 7.6 billion dollars assist Syrians outside Syria.We sending assistance two directions Syrian refugees areas liberated ISIS.The United States partners provide reconstruction funding areas controlled Assad regime political transition away Assad ’ rule.Fourth working protect innocent civilians chemical attack hold Assad accountable using heinous weapons.These past four years marked another anniversary 100th Anniversary World War One In aftermath horrible war nations came together agreed use chemical weapons again.Assad ’ continued use weapons threatens undo progress made since end terrible war.Following Assad ’ April 4 2017 sarin attack innocents President Trump launched powerful missile strike Syrian air base attack originated destroying twenty percent Syrian Air Force.Our actions sent unmistakable message using horrific weapons never acceptable hold perpetrators accountable.The United States supporting Organization Prohibition Chemical Weapons OPCW efforts compel Assad fully dismantle chemical weapons program.Unfortunately many life-saving efforts—to resolve conflict defeat ISIS deliver humanitarian aid deter chemical weapons attacks—are impeded Assad regime ’ sponsors Tehran Moscow.All civilized nations must hold Iran Russia accountable role enabling atrocities perpetuating human suffering Syria.Across greater Middle East Iran proliferating dangerous weapons fueling sectarian violence supporting terrorist proxies militias Hizballah.This regime proudly chants “ Death America ” “ Death Israel. ” It offends conscience every human denying Holocaust.In Syria Iran ’ actions directly interfered efforts de-escalate violence defeat ISIS protect innocent civilians.Since 2012 Iran provided 16 billion dollars Assad regime proxies Syria Iraq Yemen Tehran also transporting foreign Shiite militias weapons Iran Syria illegal flights including Iranian civilian airlines.Iran ’ goal secure permanent military foothold Syria would threaten Israel undermine U.S. interests strengthen terrorist proxy forces Iran uses weaken Arab states foment violence.We let happen.All responsible nations must take action counter Iran ’ destabilizing activities Syria across region.For example United States taken legislative law enforcement action Iran ’ proxy Hizballah continue call nations same.Anyone cares plight Syrians Israelis Lebanese Yemenis—and people region—should also stop business companies affiliated Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.Iran uses relationship companies fund facilitate violence terror bloodshed.Sadly Iran Assad ’ sponsor Russia also complicit Assad ’ atrocities.The Russian government bombed civilian areas provided political cover Assad ’ crimes Furthermore Russia done nothing encourage Assad ensure delivery humanitarian aid respect ceasefires de-escalation agreements comply UN Security Council Resolution 2254 ’ call UN monitored political process.From February 24 February 28 Russia conducted twenty bombing missions every day Eastern Ghouta Damascus areas Syria.Russia also repeatedly thwarted efforts OPCW hold Assad regime accountable using chemical weapons.This morning United States France Germany United Kingdom condemned abhorrent nerve-agent attack Sergei Yulia Skripal took place Salisbury United Kingdom March 4.The statement made clear believe Russia responsible attack call Russian government answer questions related incident provide full information OPCW.No nation—Russia Syria anyone else—should using chemical weapons nerve agents.If Iran Russia stop enabling regime ’ atrocities adhere UN Security Council resolutions nations must respond forcefully simply issuing strong statements.It time impose serious political economic consequences Moscow Tehran.Assad impunity crimes neither sponsors.And needed reminding importance acting need look Museum ’ powerful exhibits resources Syrian conflict.Just Museum remembers Tommy Pfeffer Oskar Schindler Hannah Senesh bears witness innocent victims righteous rescuers courageous resistors Syrian conflict.This Museum bears witness Ahmad al-Ahmad Syrian child murdered one Assad ’ chemical weapons attacks.This Museum bears witness Syrian Civil Defense—the White Helmets—unarmed first responders voluntarily put line fire save lives rescue wounded.The co-founder White Helmets Mounir Mustafa travelled way Syria colleague Radi Saad us today Thank Mounir Radi Please join giving Mounir
