dollar one stock market We ’ seen tremendous amount stock market volatility past month I ’ wondering think volatility impact real economy beyond Wall Street And I another question.MR HASSETT Yeah stock market volatility something ’ expected It ’ regular thing stock market And tends go market gone lot response policies I ’ think ’ anything unusual something people concerned about.Question here.Q Can I follow dollar sir MR HASSETT Oh dollar — Secretary Mnuchin spoken lot dollar dollar policy changed administration.Q But I ’ talking whether United States still strong-dollar policy ’ comments suggest maybe United States wants —MR HASSETT Secretary Mnuchin charge communications dollar policy.Right here.Q Can address critics say economic policies President may lead greater inflation MR HASSETT Yeah ’ right — ’ something people concerned And certainly ’ inflation data caused pause markets concerns markets.Our view policies going create growth economy supply side supply-side growth comes ’ actually good inflation increase supply puts downward pressure prices.And think get 3 percent economic growth forecast without big pickup inflation In fact CEA modeled get forward interest rates Fed forward guidance right now.Q But cut — I ’ sorry cut taxes ’ concern stoke fire inflation.MR HASSETT Yeah thanks question Well cut marginal tax rate investment happens get capital spending increases supply If ’ going something like big “ cash clunker ” program like eight years ago would increase demand cause inflation.Over front Jon.Q Just question stock market indicator The President often pointed rising stock market evidence success economic policies strength economy If stock market goes conclude reverse Should conclude President ’ economic policies failing economy healthy MR HASSETT The stock market great forward-looking indicator value firm basically market ’ assessment present value future earnings tax pre-cash flow And smoothing ups downs stock market great indicator But course going big days big days short term I ’ random walker There ’ big literature best guess stock market going tomorrow flip coin tell answer.But long run economic policy matters And I think regard stock market probably 35 percent since President elected I could run latest numbers.And ’ pretty consistent would expect given positive policy changes ’ made In particular cutting statutory corporate tax rate 35 percent 21 percent Well present value firm ’ earnings ’ one minus tax rate front If goes 0.65 0.79 means expect equity markets go But equity markets go go That ’ nature business.Q But see bear market come conclude fundamental problems economy fundamental problems President ’ policies MR HASSETT Sure If ’ bear market ’ sustained would likely happen lot bad news earnings growth state economy And stock market reasonable indicator current state economy It ’ going lot optimism President ’ policies.I ’ go middle I ’ come back front row In yellow tie And I ’ sorry I still ’ know everybody ’ names.Q That ’ right Thanks lot Kevin Have done forecasts would mean U.S. economy — net positive net negative — U.S. pull North American Free Trade Agreement MS HASSETT At CEA ’ done heck lot analysis help guide President ’ thinking trade There lot decisions coming job provide objective analysis plusses minuses moves considered That analysis course confidential ’ shared President And I ’ sure could FOIA ’ fullness time I ’ comment that.Q Well give top line Obviously ’ go analysis But would good thing U.S. economy U.S. said ’ done NAFTA MR HASSETT You know I would point trade chapter Economic Report President We really extensive discussion trade.And one things surprises economist — surprised economist — I dug details right President trade following sense That trade deals really asymmetric charge pretty much tariff imports U.S But lot trading partners either high tariffs high non-tariff barriers And even look U.S. sales autos Korea lot non-tariff barriers make U.S. firms ’ sell there.And economists sit write trade deal would two three lines It would say “ Let ’ free trade. ” Right That ’ would take Our trade deals thousands pages long thousands pages often negotiated feckless negotiators disadvantaged American workers And I think President right prioritize improving deals.Up front.Q What project labor force participation rate marginally attached labor force next 12 24 months Because President identified ’ identified priority certainly spoke behalf tax cuts tax reform thought would something positive realm next 12 24 months What project MR HASSETT Sure Downward pressure retirement Baby Boomers key underlining factor driving long-run growth But —Q Meaning labor force participation rate going people retiring MR HASSETT We fewer workers And basically fewer workers get less output And ’ going extensive analysis Economic Report President And view half retirement Baby Boomers half bad economic policies chased people away labor market including higher marginal tax rates high marginal tax rates Affordable Care Act increase use disability on.And lot reasons policies think positive effect But probably biggest effect forecast think wages going And higher wages people attracted back labor force.Q You projecting inviting American public look numbers move positive direction noticeably coming year.MR HASSETT Relative forecasts Obama administration yes It ’ still case labor force participation slight negative forecast You see inside details economic report But ’ much smaller negative Obama administration thought think ’ policies going draw people back labor force.I ’ go back here.Q Yes I wanted ask wealth inequality fact ’ growing past decades Is concern administration Is something want try combat MR HASSETT Yeah I think inequality course concern everybody studies economy people administration And inequality skyrocketed much last eight years part something talked lot fall discussing tax reform And corporate profits growing 11 percent rate per year Obama administration real wages dropping 0.4 percent year.And inequality increased lot people owned equities saw wealth go people basically lived paychecks saw wages go We think happened part chasing corporate activity overseas wealth less creating jobs Irishmen Americans.And corporate tax bill addressed would expect ’ big wage increases ’ already seen There announcements going almost 5 million people received pay raises year tax bill think ’ going reduce inequality.Now Raj ’ sort — I time couple questions MR SHAH Yeah one more.MR HASSETT Okay I ’ go right row two.Q Yeah wage increase AP reporting week Morgan Stanley survey stock analysts looking companies spending tax savings said 13 percent going workers 17 percent capital spending 43 percent dividends buybacks — shareholders Your model much higher percentage ultimately going wind pocketbook.MR HASSETT Sure And Yeah.Q So stock analysts missing MR HASSETT Well thing remember ’ starting trillions dollars parked overseas trillions dollars — monies coming home right ’ one-time adjustment And lot firms taking money ’ paying bonuses ’ also things like increasing dividends share buybacks sometimes happens firms find money.And money coming back right ’ going adjustment ’ see probably dividends share buybacks wage increases ’ cumulative past earnings.But going forward ’ going see lot capital formation wage growth ’ basically said three five years ’ get 4,000 number Right almost 5 million people 1,000 pay raise already Share buybacks gone lot ’ basically based trillions dollars used parked overseas brought home put work here.I ’ ask — last question far back.Q Thanks Kevin And couple ’ mind You sort laid foundation increasing gas tax talking ’ touched 25 years construction prices risen How realistic could hike gas tax That ’ question one.And question two look charted GDP growth 10 years ’ essentially 3 percent look past tax cuts — Reagan JFK even President talked maybe 4 5 percent — 3 percent MR HASSETT Okay ’ start gas tax In economic report chapter infrastructure talk 21st century financing mechanism might look like infrastructure talk challenges current organization presented innovation.And could imagine example thought experiment supposed everybody room everybody society electric car — ’ driving around Teslas gas tax going pay fix potholes ’ one using gasoline anymore And approach 21st century President ambitious infrastructure agenda ’ basically instructed everybody think creatively going finance make sure thing ’ legislated becomes law possible tools table.As ’ go 4 5 percent growth I think go — I think economic report extremely transparent You see get 2.2 percent baseline growth forecast one best reliable time series models literature And chapter President ’ policy objectives talk economic growth ought expect is.That gets us 3 3.2 percent — 3 percent average 10 years And ’ ’ really based hard science We 50 pages academic references back numbers come If numbers led us 5 percent would 5 percent.Let close though putting perspective The median forecast Economic Reports President going back one economic growth would 3.2 percent And ’ little bit median.The economic growth forecast Obama administration first four years would 3.2 percent They right median inherited way back Harry Truman But happened end administration kept low-growth years low-growth years — average overestimated growth eight years 1.2 percent — finally came story expect low growth forever.We CEA White House ’ accept ’ new normal We think read Economic Report President see ’ strong case made go back normal stop modifying word “ normal ” think economy.Q So expect potentially 4 percent growth higher point line Is aggressive MR HASSETT The President I talked And ’ one things — think 3 percent year looks like — 3 percent year never 3 3 3 3 3 3 A 3 percent year 4 2 4 2 And I think odds next years quarters growth excess 3 probably pretty high given ambitious policy agenda ’ already partially enacted.And I guess Raj telling I go And thank much attention It ’ honor again.Q There ’ fear recession anywhere foreseeable future MR HASSETT Oh I think economists always attentive developments wary exogenous factors ’ anticipate I think unconditional laws recession something people study like Jim Stock Harvard talk about.But right ’ much momentum economy ’ heading Q1 three quarters row average 3 percent Our models suggest first quarter little bit inventory drag fourth quarter offset Q1 And right ’ looking economy ’ solid good ’ seen since financial crisis.Thank much.MR SHAH Thanks Kevin Moving saw yesterday President hosted extraordinary listening session students teachers families impacted school shootings.It emotionally incredibly constructive conversation It included many perspectives different opinions And focused solutions exactly President looking As President tweeted yesterday “ I ’ always remember time I spent today courageous students teachers families So much love midst much pain We must let We must keep children safe. ” Today conversation continued local leaders The President knows best ideas usually come local level Washington D.C. ’ certainly case here.Next week President welcome governors White House top issue school safety.I ’ like quickly follow question I got April Ryan last week She asked Violence Against Women Office Department Justice The President ’ proposed budget fiscal year 2019 increase funding Office Violence Against Women 3 million Our goal ensure funding maximum impact providing support assistance survivors combatting domestic dating violence stalking sexual assault.Finally two quick things I ’ like point taking questions First new Gallup survey today shows percentage Americans satisfied United States standing world increased 13 percentage points single year President That 13-year high.And last certainly least I ’ like offer congratulations one colleagues ’ today Margaret Brennan announced new host Face Nation.So I ’ take questions I ’ start Major.Q Thank Raj Would summarize us President intends terms legislation propose Congress guns He raised lot issues yesterday raised today second listening session Is going send bill Congress authored administration outlining wants Or going leave Congress decide propose vote MR SHAH Well President proposing ideas He ’ listening right He ’ talking series ideas He ’ talked strengthening background checks emphasis mental health He ’ also talked raising age gun sales He ’ talked ending bump stocks — sale bump stocks And ’ also state laws books ’ continuing look at.So right ’ listening phase I ’ say ’ going propose things specific legislative language But going come forward later something little bit concrete.Q But think example bump stocks questions best way approach Congress write law sign Because ’ pretty specific consistent point Regulations helpful laws better Does believe Congress rewrite laws conjunction consistent priorities outlined MR SHAH Well I think points could different approach In areas state laws make sense In areas —Q Such MR SHAH Well I mean — I think states red-flag laws example remove firearms go judge potentially dangerous individuals That ’ something ’ done right variety states right They due process rights individuals It seems working certain areas That ’ something ’ looking places ’ looking at.Q So would look federally MR SHAH Right ’ consideration ’ mean ’ I think want say though issue bump stocks outlined ’ already ordered Department Justice

sense I think need look first policy want come forward right legislative approach federal state level.Jonathan.Q Hey Raj President talked arming teachers capable handling firearms There 3.5 million teachers roughly United States He said would 20 percent That ’ 700,000 teachers How would President propose arming 700,000 teachers MR SHAH Well I think President talked taking individuals personnel within schools — could teachers could individuals training already use firearms could gain training — making sure individuals access concealed weapons school grounds In instances presence individuals would deter potential attackers.Q But numbers ’ talking 700,000 teachers school personnel maybe even armed schools How practical How wise 700,000 firearms schools MR SHAH Well I think horrific situation like last week school shootings ’ seen horrible tragedies think ’ think practical change.John.Q In order something like effective ’ get buy-in many many school boards across country.MR SHAH Of course.Q So far much reaction ’ seen idea negative Does President expect get enough buy-in order send signal potential shooters hardened facility walk doors said little ago ’ going last long MR
