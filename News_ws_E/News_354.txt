done last — I guess ’ little less two weeks — ’ looked governors done We ’ brought people together I ’ appreciative President done bringing us together talk also last week bringing people together created momentum make sure something happens time ’ go nothing happen.So state way I ’ done I ’ broken three things Number one ’ going school safety No parent state going say “ I ’ concerned whether child go school safely. ” If go school Florida ’ going know child come home safely If ’ teacher work one schools ’ going know ’ going come home safely That ’ step one.We ’ going spend 500 million I two weeks left legislative session I ’ waiting federal government We ’ going invest 500 million ’ going significant law enforcement presence every public school state.We ’ already investing dollars hardening schools We ’ going invest lot state dollars ’ going say local dollars go capital outlay school districts first thing dollars spent school hardening It ’ important thing harden schools So ’

around.GOVERNOR IVEY Thank Mr. President Like I believe local officials awful lot insight school needs provide public school safety So I mentioned little earlier group Mr. President I suggested give local folks list things quickly like limit number entrances school enter building And equip every child 6th grade chip-activated card enter entrance.And also consider putting metal detector one two three entrances since ’ limiting number entrances Also surveillance system And surveillance system tied virtual Alabama Visual Center Education Department ’ instant information time.Certainly training mental health situation fine immediate I think need give guidance local people limit access entrancing equip surveillance systems metal detectors whatever choose Where money coming They ’ got local money state budget ’ technology fund And senator I working introduced bill last week able free money use school safety.So costly things things done immediately improve school safety.THE PRESIDENT That ’ great Thank Thank much Kay.How going around room Anybody great ideas suggestions Governor GOVERNOR INSLEE Thanks Mr. President Two comments One state Washington Thank you.We program called Extreme Risk Protection Orders System supremely effective allowing family members realize ’ risk separated firearm It involves judicial decision It involves hearing And saved lives I ’ sure state Washington.And I would commend national attention makes sure uncle might — concern depression — allows law enforcement separate uncle depressed uncle firearm If somebody family might violent tendencies hearing potential ex parte order get order actually allow law enforcement remove It ’ operation year It ’ extremely successful I would commend you.Second issue Now I know suggested arming teachers And I —THE PRESIDENT No No Not teachers.GOVERNOR INSLEE Not teachers.THE PRESIDENT Arming small portion gun adept truly know handle Because I feel Governor ’ important gun-free zones — gun-free zone ’ like invitation sick people go there.I think form major retaliation ’ able enter school And happens ’ going problems anymore ’ never going school You ’ never going problem.So would small group people gun adept Anyway go ahead Governor.GOVERNOR INSLEE If I may respond Let suggest whatever percentage — I heard one time might suggested 20 percent — whatever percentage speaking grandfather speaking Governor state Washington I listened people would affected I listened biology teachers ’ want percentage I ’ listened first-grade teachers ’ want pistol-packing first-grade teachers I ’ listened law enforcement said ’ want train teachers law enforcement agents takes six months.Now I think circumstance need listen educators educate foisted upon responsibility packing heat first grade classes.Now I understand suggested And suggest things sometimes listen people maybe ’ look good little later So I suggest need little less tweeting little listening And let ’ take table move forward.THE PRESIDENT All right Thank much You know number states right And I think mind I ’ call Greg Abbott great governor Texas Greg.GOVERNOR ABBOTT Sure Texas authorized schools adopt policies implement school marshal program individuals would trained weapon able use weapon And well hundred school districts state Texas teachers people work school carry weapon trained able respond attack occurs.Now ’ always schoolteacher It could coach could administrator could anybody works school But ’ well-thought-out program lot training advance And candidly school districts promote Because signs front — warning sign “ Be aware armed personnel campus ” — warning anybody coming — attempt cause harm ’ going trouble.THE PRESIDENT Well I think ’ great And essentially ’ saying sick individual comes school expect major trouble Right Major trouble The bullets going going toward also And I think ’ great And know ’ going happen Nobody going school Greg That ’ big difference.That really well said Thank much Anybody Governors quiet I ’ believe it.GOVERNOR HUTCHINSON Mr. President —THE PRESIDENT So well behaved today I ’ believe Laughter GOVERNOR HUTCHINSON We ’ start acting soon Laughter. Mr President I want say Arkansas similar situation program Greg described Texas I belief teacher compelled want teach focus But others concerned students training specific capacity described.And licensed certain school districts want trained significantly handle active shooter situation And 13 schools Arkansas ’ afford school resource officer They prefer either classroom assistant coach somebody would response capability And ’ key thing So flexibility.I think governors want say ’ necessarily national security plan states develop this.And make recommendations back 2012 though reference federal grants Some biggest expense training Some biggest expense hardening schools Governor Ivey suggested And I hope Department Homeland Security — looking grants come DHS terms security fighting terrorists — money utilized local jurisdictions well protection number-one priority protecting students schools.THE PRESIDENT Yes And Governor know well ’ It ’ never-ending quest But respect MS-13 people really causing havoc certain communities schoolchildren people walking home school — ’ going And ’ moving thousands.But get immigration laws allow us able They soft No country world immigration laws soft like So ’ also part it.I appreciate said Thank much Governor Yes Paul.GOVERNOR LEPAGE Mr. President I would ask address Congress ask look HIPAA laws particularly mental illness Because need help federal government loosen laws truly good background checks people.THE PRESIDENT Good And ’ ’ going And know Paul ’ really I think going support NRA background checks — strong background checks — heavy section mental health far different ’ past.Thank Paul Yes ’ Yes.GOVERNOR MARTINEZ Thank Mr. President allowing us governors participate give perspectives states different And I ’ thanked something engaged previous administrations.I see huge pool retired law enforcement officers municipalities counties actually invested lot money training ’ retired And often receiving public retirement go back similar kind retirement plan If go educational plan actually work school trained The school ’ train But also learn figure cameras different security pieces need implemented within schools experience training.And pool folks immediately put without expend great amount dollars keeping schools school personnel safe.THE PRESIDENT That ’ well said The fact teacher coach somebody ’ adept — adept lot people ’ anything ’ know looks like ’ lift But adept weaponry guns And small number ’ need many.But learned lot weekend last week saw man properly armed standing outside probably afraid go And turns probably four They ’ love students ’ know students The teachers love students want protect students.The thing cost The school Florida large Rick Such big school You would 100 150 guards I mean would lot guards building properly manned Then armed camp Whereas like I think ’ suggesting like many people room agree costs almost nothing I would actually give bonus every coach teacher et cetera go training As good go strong strenuous training But I would like give bonus.So let ’ say gave thousand-dollar bonus year ’ 50 60 school — compare paying 40,000 50,000 60,000 Where schools going get kind money Somebody suggested last night “ We ’ going harden doors We ’ going make impossible get in. ” I said “ That ’ good except one instance killer gets closes doors ’ get school. ” They said “ Ah I never thought that. ” Don ’ forget I real estate business And harden schools ’ going get But get ’ getting Law enforcement getting in.Somebody else said “ Oh something ’ working on. ” Wait see cost things Smoke fills school Smoke So guy standing weapon ’ getting crazy ’ smoke All ’ going shoot endlessly He ’ going go nuts This another plan new one I ’ sure put company wants make lot money “ Smoke going fill room fills hallways. ” That ’ going help And law enforcement going go fight smoke They ’ going know ’ shooting This serious plan And I think I talked particular person it.But I really — I — talk hardening The thing Harden You harden The cost schools communities federal government astronomical When start putting main doors closing doors changing hallways around changing — ’ talking hundreds hundreds billions dollars And nothing.As great Governor Texas others — I think nine states way ’ thrilled They ’ thrilled And know says “ Come folks Come in. ” But ’ coming ’ want get shot.Look guy Cruz He leaves students He tried sneak away And I ’ tell one policeman good job one caught couple communities away It ’ even Rick community I know communities But ’ community It ’ sort far away.And said “ That ’ guy I think maybe based description. ” And went got Now would gotten anyway I guess knows much damage would inflicted So great job.Look law enforcement great But learn something saw Peterson standing outside school He wanted part He heard power heard probably screaming bullets wanted part And three guys came help They wanted part That terrible terrible job The worse job ’ nab guy earlier 39 red flags That worse job.So — I think learned lot But ’ retribution ’ going something serious guys walk ’ going keep walking You ’ going time You ’ going — know walk ’ going probably end dead And know ’ going end dead ’ going school.Question Yes Matt GOVERNOR BEVIN I ’ beg differ said But ’ talking things costly — monetary cost.I think ’ important us start every level office respective offices well seize bully pulpits talk culture society And I would challenge media would want mock ridicule would want say anybody advocates find fault person reason person one advocating higher level moral authority higher mores think twice children grandchildren well.And mock ridicule foundational principles nation built upon treat people way ’ want treated respect human life respect dignity women children people increasingly degraded society This culture death becoming pervasive.And ’ addressed imperfect people room sense purpose sense aspiration I think ’ going see continued trajectory ’ good.Many things changed There always guns And fewer restrictions There always guns homes fewer rules It ’ say rules restrictions necessarily bad.But changed ’ relates acknowledging value dignity every human life And couple number psychiatric drugs increasingly systemic severe warnings associated related depression suicidal thoughts — put things mess one among us bold enough willing step challenge fact problem This goes unchecked.And I would call sir I ’ calling fellow governors seize opportunities call America higher action relates mores.THE PRESIDENT Good.GOVERNOR BEVIN Thank you.THE PRESIDENT Thank Matt And ’ ’ And I think — know I ’ know ’ going mentioned also look videos They ’ vicious You look videos I mean I ’ know young kid ’ mind Somebody growing forming looking videos people blown away left right.The Internet movies — look movies today I see commercial level craziness viciousness movies I think look Maybe put rating system They rating system subjects Maybe rating system that.But impact — ’ — ’ take many minds If 1 percent less ’ lot It ’ takes It takes one person tremendous damage So I think ’ something look also.Question Yes Governor.GOVERNOR BULLOCK Mr. President thank us I approach certainly governor I approach gun owner 11-year-old got first deer —THE PRESIDENT That ’ right.GOVERNOR BULLOCK — past fall.THE PRESIDENT He ’ good boy.GOVERNOR BULLOCK I approach victim I nephew shot killed — 11-year-old — playground I approach parent three young kids saying like every parent grandparent need everything keep kids safe.I think parenthetically sometimes language use help define things certainly understand idea hardening schools But seems like ’ hardening potential military targets I think leaders need saying ’ going everything make school safe kids.I think steps many begin reference could take could make difference If look public health issue You mentioned NICS system We improve instant check system And also know quarter guns sold ’ even get system So universal background check We know 10 percent homicides year intimate relationships So orders protection domestic violence making sure ’ NICS.As Governor Scott mentioned red-flag laws Making sure law enforcement families way still using due process actually remove guns people might imminent threat.I applaud bump stocks That ’ one things reason And could certainly look higher magazine capacity well It ’ one things probably ’ need.And I encourage go path looking schools — I used attorney general ran law enforcement academy would graduate police officers every year I want make sure somebody armed school training know — ’ much I think recognize carrying concealed — training I parent say person pressure know firearm start introducing firearms schools.I think ’ unique — hopefully ’ unique moment — certainly I said — know 43 times since I ’ governor I ’ asked lower flags Twelve mass shootings last five years.It ’ almost one hand point ’ getting desensitized hand moment everybody talking hopefully start saying “ What could actually meaningfully impact today future ” So thank much.THE PRESIDENT Thank Governor.GOVERNOR BULLOCK And I hope areas ’ certainly take bully pulpit leadership Congress.THE PRESIDENT Thank much Great points It great last night.You mentioned two words pressure And lot people never really know means know train whole life Look Peterson Look Broward thought probably brave guy ’ brave guy pressure He choked And people choked I mean lot people choked case.And people trained We — know kind budget works When many governors happen know like idea trained people within schools press get word honestly.For instance I went detailed — could 10 percent could 5 percent could 20 percent — really gun-adept people Very people would qualify On top gun adept go school learn know maybe bonus given people maybe frankly Because go yearly basis school They start training additional training every year And I think get bonus But ’ small amount money compared would cost I think would effective.But press covered headline “ Trump wants teachers guns. ” “ Trump wants teachers guns. ” I ’ want teachers guns I want highly trained people natural talent like hitting baseball hitting golf ball putting How come people always make four-footer people pressure ’ even take club back Right Some people ’ take club back.And ’ know You know words hard train want number people people know ’ going — bad guy understand ’ big price pay mess around students You ’ say “ Oh ’ going harden schools We ’ going blow smoke rooms We ’ going stuff going work. ” You let people know ’ going suffer ultimate price.And know And I said — ’ going incidents ’ going ’ innately cowards But I love said I agree much said.Question Governor — Phil.GOVERNOR BRYANT Mr. President October 1st 1997 Luke Woodham 16-year-old student came Pearl High School Pearl Mississippi bludgeoned mother death morning 30-30 lever-action rifle killed two students began shoot others A vice principal Army Reserve officer went vehicle retrieved 1911 .45 stopped shooter could kill children Pearl Mississippi.When I heard speak idea concept I believed Find Army Reserve vice principal give training necessarily needs arm stop madness.THE PRESIDENT Thank Phil.GOVERNOR BRYANT Thank sir.THE PRESIDENT Well many people teachers They ’ retired They ’ 20 years Marines They handle weapon world-class They ’ even need training get anyway Everybody strong training.But know many — like General Kelly standing back I ’ mind teacher I ’ like teacher And happened concealed — carrying concealed — I ’ feel good That better.And ’ site Don ’ forget — thing Phil ’ site They ’ outside They ’ 20 minutes away police station alarm rings go time get ’ know school ’ know floors These people know everything intimately I think works.Look I ’ watching — I ’ two-and-a-half years After I civilian And I nice life I easy nice beautiful life I actually got great press I king getting good press Governor You know It I I got bad press Laughter But know I ’ watching folks different slant Many politicians long time I ’ watching I ’ watching everybody — 30 years I ’ watching situation Nothing done It ’ thing Nothing done.They meeting They go home Two weeks later ’ little bit — sadly — I hate say — parents devastated families badly affected people hit You know nobody ever talks wounded They talk 17 dead But I ’ — know I saw people — Rick — seriously wounded Nobody ever talks.The maniac West Side Highway ran eight people — keep saying “ He killed eight people. ” He took — ’ essentially park It ’ like beautiful stretch along Hudson River I know well.He ’ going 80 miles hour West Side Highway said “ Hey look people I ’ going turn it. ” And killed eight people What ’ talk 14 people devastated They go put shape work ’ proud end missing leg missing arm missing two legs arm.And nobody ever talks people They talk people

two Yes Governor.GOVERNOR HERBERT Again thank I ’ enjoyed hearing fellow colleagues ’ going respective states And reminds complex issue There simple solution unfortunately us I think ’ roles play federal government — things ’ proposing.But I think solutions going come states We states things arming personnel inside school system seem think working well I know I ’ working legislature recently last night talking cost education What cost — ’ businessman — business.THE PRESIDENT That ’ right That ’ right.GOVERNOR HERBERT Some fact embedding law enforcement trained personnel whatever form fashion want going additional cost That ’ result society today How ’ got kind society — Governor Bevin — things desensitizing children challenges life today complexities — knows But I believe Each state going find way based culture based politics based unique demographics And ’ learn We ’ find works ’ homogenize probably together.But states little pilot programs ’ beauty concept federalism And states finding solutions problems ail people.This problem today safety schools I look learn tried way Utah find solution critical timely issue.Thanks leadership.THE PRESIDENT Thank Governor I appreciate And said something important The states various programs without federal government also.And ’ help ’ help monetarily — important lot school budgets especially ’ money I mean going get money put 100 guards school Parkland I mean ’ tough It ’ tough situation.But federal government help out.But lot solutions talk — whether agree agree somebody else — pretty much within state Like great governor Texas Greg — attitude retribution Because I say way stop retribution I ’ think ’ going stop kind I ’ think ’ going stop You ’ going problems.But state feels way I say go I guess nine states ’ Greg — least nine And coming ’ coming fast But states lot work They it.And ’ back regardless want If agree disagree state Texas states differently I think ’ fine Just go We help matter solution is.But largely state issue terms school ’ security And many cases ’ local issue You know many cases ’ even need approval state You go school district safety children So attitude Get done get
