Wolfgang You entire team done wonderful job organizing important conference I also want thank Chancellor Merkel German Government German people generous hospitality gracious welcome For visiting Germany feels like coming home And I know I speak entire American delegation I say wish Senator John McCain great advocate conference could join us.It great honor The Munich Security Conference convenes unmatched assembly distinguished leaders thinkers For five decades conference fostered open dialogue candid debate lively discussion might build peaceful prosperous future together This year meet critical time nations—and indeed humanity.Critical face range common threats Rogue regimes already imperil international security Middle East northeast Asia developing destructive weapons earth Revisionist powers challenging stability postwar international order military force pernicious forms aggression And jihadist terrorist organizations continue use mass murder innocents principal tactic evil war civilized people.Although distinct three threats often intersect example Syria.To address threats improve international security must renew faith principles made nations strong increased worldwide prosperity prevented Great Power conflict 70 years.The United States allies partners proud nations patriotic people cherish ideals liberty individual rights free enterprise equality rule law In free open societies artists intellectuals inventors expand hearts enliven imaginations push us new frontiers science exploration We proud achieved around world safeguard principles defend security unleash human potential.This month celebrating Berlin Wall—and barbed wire fences divided German people—have longer stood I Germany wall fell Our cavalry regiment patrolling border near Coburg East German travel restrictions lifted That day experienced invasion unanticipated kind joyous East Germans brought us flowers wine celebrate reunions friends family—and newfound freedom Those moments remain among fondest memories—when Freedom triumphed oppression.Our shared history reminds us common principles democratic values enduring commitment peace Ewald von Kleist founded conference 1963 following two horrific world wars hopes preventing future conflict.To realize noble vision must share responsibility International peace prosperity depends nations.For reason President Trump called stronger alliances partnerships based shared values shared interests shared responsibilities shared burdens.Today I would like highlight three priority areas demand collective efforts first ensuring non-proliferation weapons mass destruction deterring use second defeating jihadist terrorist organizations third strengthening international foundations peace prosperity.Over past four years commemorated various 100-year anniversaries World War I—a war witnessed routine use chemical weapons causing immense human suffering In wake war nations came together agreed use horrifying weapons battlefield.In April 2017 Assad regime used heinous weapons innocents United States responded We acted deter future chemical attacks ensure use weapons never became routine Public accounts photos clearly show Assad ’ chemical weapons use continuing It time nations hold Syrian regime sponsors accountable actions support efforts Organization Prohibition Chemical Weapons.The non-proliferation regime tremendous pressure—not use chemical weapons also development proliferation nuclear weapons It needs unequivocal support.Last year nations gathered initiated international campaign denuclearize Korean Peninsula We must pressure Kim regime—using available tools—to ensure cruel dictatorship threaten world destructive weapons earth.Many us proud successes uniting behind United Nations Security Council resolutions Today let us resolve enforce existing sanctions also commit downgrading diplomatic relations cutting trade military commercial ties expelling so-called guest workers.Nations evade full enforcement fail take steps acting irresponsibly Now time more—a nuclear North Korea poses direct threat us seriously undermines non proliferation regime.We know Syria North Korea rogue states developing spreading dangerous weapons.Now also time address serious flaws Iran deal counter Iran ’ destabilizing activities including development proliferation missiles—and support terrorist proxies militias fuel destructive conflicts across greater Middle East The Iranian regime foments violence support commercial entities affiliated Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps IRGC—including Mahan Air lands right Munich Airport.As matter international security moral conscience must stop business IRGC-affiliated interests encourage development true commercial sector Iran pressure regime respect rights people.The second area deserves continued attention defeating terrorist organizations threaten citizens way life In recent months working together made enormous strides preventing terrorist attacks denying terrorists control territory populations cutting funding discrediting wicked ideology.Over past year come together partnership create two new centers Saudi Arabia dedicated countering jihadist ideology inhibiting terrorist financing.In Syria Iraq Coalition Defeat ISIS liberated territory previously held terrorists We continue efforts pursue ISIS fighters secure populations stabilize areas facilitate safe return suffered grip evil organization.And Afghanistan heroic Afghan partners working alongside American NATO international forces ensure better future children If work together opportunity act Taliban Haqqani Network leaders many live safety luxury outside Afghanistan plotting murder innocents.To ensure progress counterterrorism non-proliferation must ALSO focus third area transcends efforts strengthening international foundations peace prosperity.In arena much work International institutions created foster peace facilitate cooperation threat nations subvert corrupt intended purpose For example egregious human rights abusers sit United Nations Human Rights Council And trade organizations like WTO unable constrain countries ignore stated principles refuse follow rules.We must actively cooperate protect reform strengthen institutions honor original aims—and serve interests states value rule law human dignity.As President Trump noted address UN General Assembly success international organizations also depends strength independent sovereign members.Unfortunately respect sovereignty siege around world.Some dangerous forms aggression fall threshold military action.We allow repressive revisionist powers diminish confidence sacred principles undermine free market system interfere democratic processes As seen recent days United States expose act use cyberspace social media means advance campaigns disinformation subversion espionage.We already improving ability defeat pernicious threats For example April last year nine countries including United States established new European Center Excellence Countering Hybrid Threats This center help free nations defend cyber attacks political subversion—preserving way life common action.Our nations safer cooperate advance shared goals We strong faith values pride heritage resolve part peace.If renew commitment noble principles together face today ’ threats defeat We uphold non-proliferation regime We defeat jihadist terrorist organizations We protect way life And fulfill visionary dream conference ’ founder even wake two devastating world wars nations might come together build future hope light promise Thank
