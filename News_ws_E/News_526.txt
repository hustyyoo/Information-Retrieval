dinner last night 15 leaders industry none I knew I ’ read years And truly incredible group But I think I 15 new friends So really great ’ done putting together economic forum.The tax reform dream lot people many years ’ able get done Many people tried Ronald Reagan really last make meaningful cut reform And cutting reforming We emphasize cut reform probably almost important We ’ wanted It tough politically Hard believe would tough That ’ ’ done close 40 years.And got going going And big — I ’ say total surprise one big things happened took place AT T others came early said going pay thousands thousands dollars people work companies And 300,000 400,000 500,000 people working companies sudden became like big waterfall big beautiful waterfall many companies And even today announced many But every day announce And ’ fight ’ going give It started 1,000 3,000.This something ’ anticipate Oftentimes business things happen ’ anticipate Usually ’ bad thing good thing This came nowhere Nobody ever thought possibility even It ’ equation We waited — said wait February 1st checks start coming And people Klaus lot money paycheck — ’ little money lot money people making living whatever may doing.And really though February 1st going kick everybody going — well ’ even gotten yet ’ kicked And ’ incredible impact stock market stock prices We ’ set 84 records since election — record stock market prices meaning hit new highs 84 different times one-year period And ’ great thing And fairness done passed tax cuts tax reform.So happened really something special Then know I said Apple came 350 billion And I tell I spoke Tim Cook I said Tim I never consider whole great run ’ made complete start building plants U.S. And I tell moved substantially But I heard 350 I thought talking — I thought talking 350 million And way ’ nice-sized plant Not greatest bad And said “ No sir It ’ 350 billion. ” I said something.Well tremendous amounts money including newfound friends last night — great companies They ’ investing When one gentlemen said ’ putting 2 billion tax cuts I said “ Wow ’ actually cheap one group ” — ’ putting massive numbers billions dollars.So I think brand-new United States You United States people world looking come invest ’ nothing like ’ happening.And I want finish — I group people — I whole lot I ’ introduce I ’ insult least half But I ’ group people worked hard things.And ’ really — great first year — successful many different ways And ’ tremendous spirit When look different charts polls see example African American unemployment historic low — ’ never period time like Same Hispanic Women 17-year low It ’ heartwarming see But ’ tremendous spirit United States I would say ’ spirit like I never witnessed I ’ awhile I never witnessed spirit country

great experience I ’ loved I ’ always loved business I ’ always good building things I ’ always successful making money I ’ buy things would fail –that would failures — I ’ turn around try get right price I ’ turn around make successful And I ’ good And takes certain ability.And know historically I guess ’ never really businessman businessperson elected President It ’ always general politician Throughout history ’ always general — general — mostly politicians You never businessman.And fairness I saying Klaus last night Had opposing party — backed people room — instead almost 50 percent — stock market since election almost 50 percent — rather I believe stock market level initial level would close 50 percent That ’ heading I really believe — going put massive new regulations You ’ breathe It choking country death And I able see Klaus businessperson.The thing I ’ always seemed get whatever reason disproportionate amount press media Laughter Throughout whole life — somebody explain someday — I ’ always gotten lot Laughter And businessman I always treated really well press The numbers speak things happen I ’ always really good press And ’ I became politician I realized nasty mean vicious fake press As cameras start going background Laughter But overall — I mean bottom line — somebody said well ’ bad — ’ President And I think ’ really great job team I team tremendous people I think ’ special job And I really believe time time job I ’ think United States would done well went four eight years regulation really anti-business group people.We pro-business group We regulations cut level — history country Klaus — reported recently In one year ’ cut regulations administration administration four eight sixteen years one case We ’ cut regulations one year ways go I mean ’ probably 50 percent done.And ’ going regulation There ’ nothing wrong rules regulations need But ’ cut administration ever history country still ways go So I think tremendous tax cuts ’ really done something.And one thing I said — I saw last night leaders businesspeople — I think I ’ cheerleader country everybody representing company country cheerleader matter ’ going work And reason I ’ cheerleader ’ easy — I love country I think ’ really well.And look forward seeing America — special place — special place also.Thank much I appreciate Applause.
